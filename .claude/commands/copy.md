# Write Pedal Demo Copy

A custom command to write engaging, succinct copy for guitar pedal demos in the style of loopydemos.com.

## Command

You are tasked with writing copy for a guitar pedal demo. The user will provide the maker and model name. You need to:

1. **Research the pedal** - Use web search to understand the pedal's features, specifications, and character
2. **Find the existing demo file** - Look for `src/content/demos/[maker-model-slug].md` and read it
3. **Write engaging copy** - Replace the placeholder text with 3-4 succinct paragraphs

## Writing Style Guidelines

Based on the existing content, follow these style principles:

### Tone & Voice
- **Conversational and personal** - Use "I" statements and personal experiences.
- **Honest and balanced** - Include both positives and limitations
- **Technically informed but accessible** - Explain technical details in relatable terms
- **Enthusiastic but not sales-y** - Show genuine appreciation without being promotional. But keep it humble and don't overhype.

### Structure
- **4 paragraphs maximum** - Keep it concise and punchy
- **Lead with the main appeal** - Start with what makes the pedal special
- **Technical details in context** - Explain how features affect the sound/experience
- **Practical insights** - Include usage tips, settings, or gotchas
- **Conclude with assessment** - Who it's for and what it excels at
- **Do not quote actual prices** - The price can change, so avoid mentioning it directly

### Language Patterns
- Use contractions and casual language
- Include specific technical details (circuit types, controls, voltages)
- Mention how pedals interact with other gear
- Reference playing dynamics and responsiveness
- Use descriptive sound words (grinding, loose, tight, punchy, etc.)

### Content to Include
- **Circuit type and design** - JFET, tube, op-amp, etc.
- **Key controls and their function** - How they shape the sound
- **Practical usage scenarios** - What it's good for, how to use it
- **Stacking and interaction** - How it works with other pedals/amps
- **Honest limitations** - What it doesn't do well
- **Value proposition** - Why someone should consider it

### Examples of Good Opening Lines
- "The [Pedal Name] nails that [specific tone/era] in a [simple/compact] [pedal type]"
- "I love the [Pedal Name] because it just [does specific thing really well]"
- "[Pedal Name] is one of those pedals that [specific quality/behavior]"

### Common Technical Elements to Address
- **Overdrive/Distortion**: Gain range, clipping type, responsiveness
- **Fuzz**: Character (gated, sustained, velcro), cleanup, stacking
- **Modulation**: LFO type, rate ranges, expressiveness
- **Delay/Reverb**: Algorithms, feedback behavior, modulation
- **Amp-in-a-box**: Amp model, EQ capabilities, headroom

### Practical Details to Include
- **Controls sensitivity** - Volume pot ranges, sweet spots
- **Power considerations** - Voltage switching, current draw
- **I/O features** - Multiple outputs, effects loops, bypass types
- **Build quality** - Size, weight, durability observations

## Process

1. **Research phase**: Web search for reviews, specifications, and user experiences
2. **Style analysis**: Read 2-3 existing demo files to refresh on voice and structure
3. **Content creation**: Write 3-4 focused paragraphs following the guidelines
4. **Refinement**: Edit for conciseness and punch - every sentence should earn its place

## Example Structure

**Paragraph 1**: Hook + main appeal + basic operation
**Paragraph 2**: Technical details + sound character + responsiveness  
**Paragraph 3**: Practical features + usage scenarios + any limitations
**Paragraph 4**: Bottom line assessment + who it's for + final thoughts

Remember: The goal is to help readers understand what the pedal sounds like, how it behaves, and whether it's right for them - all in a conversational, informative style that respects their time.
