excerpt: A shootout of four different delay pedals. The BOSS DM-2w, Caroline Guitar Co. Kilobyte, Crazy Tube Circuits TI:ME and NativeAudio Wilderness.

I was fortunate enough to have a bunch of delays at hand and I compared them. From simple to highly adjustable, there is a pedal that stretches time just how you like it.

### BOSS DM-2w

The DM-2w is a super simple delay. Just 3 knobs and a mode switch. And yet, to me it's one of the best sounding and feeling delays I've tried.

It's perfectly voiced. The modulation and degradation of the repeats is not too obvious but enough to add a very pleasant character to it.

This is a staple on my board because it's very easy for me to find a setting that I like.

### Caroline Guitar Co. Kilobyte

The Kilobyte also strikes a nice balance of simplicity, while adding some unique features and sounds.

My favorite feature is the "gain" control, which only adds distortion to the delay repeats.

### Crazy Tube Circuits TI:ME

The TI:ME is a great universal delay for every board. You can tune it exactly to your liking. I especially like the tone knob, which can make the repeats muddy and soft to just add ambience or make them present for rhythmic delay parts.

I also like the super pragmatic approach for the tempo tapping with the added subdivision toggle.

### NativeAudio Wilderness

The Wilderness is another little swiss army knife for creating delay sounds. I like the added control of the modulation (depth and rate).

Also, with the feedback knob at around 2 o'clock, there is a nice overdrive happening in the repeats which adds to its lovely character.
