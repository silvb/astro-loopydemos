### Big Muff Pi (NYC)

This is the classic that most people of my generation are familiar with. It's identical to the [big box NYC version](/demos/ehx-big-muff-nyc).

Most bands that recorded in the 90s, 2000s and 2010s probably have used this circuit or a version close to it live and in studio.

The highs are less pronounced compared to the other variants. There is plenty of mid scoop happening.
