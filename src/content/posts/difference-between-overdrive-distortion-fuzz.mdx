I've loved Big Muffs since I started my first band (back in the days of 2008).

I only knew that my favorite bands like the White Stripes, Black Keys, Dinosaur Jr., Smashing Pumpkins, Wolfmother all use some version of this box for most of their signature sounds.

Only years later, Electro Harmonix released the Big Muff Nano Series. A series of Big Muff reissues that pretty much covers all the highlights of EHX's history of Big Muffs. And all of them are housed in a cute, pedalboard-friendly nano-sized enclosure.

To the outsider, comparing all these versions of the same base circuit might seem like cork-sniffery.

When I realised my idea to do a back-to-back comparison of all these versions, I was surprised by how different all of these variants actually sound.

### Big Muff Pi (NYC)

This is the classic that most people of my generation are familiar with. It's identical to the [big box NYC version](/demos/ehx-big-muff-nyc).

Most bands that recorded in the 90s, 2000s and 2010s probably have used this circuit or a version close to it live and in studio.

The highs are less pronounced compared to the other variants. There is plenty of mid scoop happening.
