Classic rock guitar tone is almost synonymous with the sound of a cranked Marshall® Plexi.

Unfortunately, cranking a Plexi is not always an option. Neighbors, parents, or sleeping children, and the sheer cost of a full stack are all factors that impede us from unleashing that roaring tone at its full volume.

Plexi-style pedals offer a great solution to achieve that iconic sound at any volume.

### Catalinbread - Dirty Little Secret Deluxe

<DlsDemo />

If you want to go all-in on Plexi-style distortion, the Dirty Little Secret Deluxe from Catalinbread packs all the tones you need for that sound. It has a 4-band EQ, a stackable boost and a switchable Marshall® Super Lead and Super Bass modes.

The Super Lead mode is the classic Plexi sound, while the Super Bass mode is a bit more bassy with a bit more gain. The boost is a great addition to the pedal, as it can be used to push the pedal into more gain, or to push the amp into more gain. The 4-band EQ allows you to dial in the exact tone you want.

### Funny Little Boxes - 1991

<Flb1991Demo />

The story of this funny little box in a nutshell is that it was designed to emulate the sound of Pearl Jam's Ten album (released in 1991).

In practice, this means smashing a TubeScreamer-style overdrive into a Plexi-style high gain amp. All this is packaged in a cleverly designed user interface with just a 3-band EQ, dual gain and volume – all of which are very interactive.

To be honest, I'm not really into Pearl Jam and I couldn't tell you if this pedal feels like the Ten album sounds. I just know this is a great distortion/overdrive pedal that feels inspiring to play, looks cool and sounds great. On top of that, it's the most affordable pedal on this list.44

### Alexander Pedals - Jubilee Silver Overdrive

<JubileeDemo />

The Alexander Pedals Jubilee Silver Overdrive is the simplest pedal from the list but it delivers nonetheless. It's a single-channel distortion box with a 3-band EQ and a gain and volume knob. The EQ is – typical for a Plexi-style amp – comprised of cut controls for the 3 bands. Turning them fully clockwise will give you no filtering, while turning them fully counter-clockwise will attenuate the respective frequency band.

If you're simply looking for that typical Plexi sound in a box without any complications, the Jubilee Silver Overdrive delivers the vibe and the tone.
