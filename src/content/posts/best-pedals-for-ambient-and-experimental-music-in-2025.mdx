When you dive into ambient and experimental music, pedals aren’t just effects, but instruments in their own right. A single delay can turn a simple chord into a shifting landscape, while a reverb can stretch one note into something infinite and otherworldly.

Nowadays, there’s a huge number of pedals that go far beyond basic effects, combining modulation, pitch shifting, reverse delays, and even built-in sequencers. In this article, we’ll explore what 2025 has to offer in terms of rule-bending effects that could be the next big addition to your ambient/experimental pedalboard.

### Essential Pedals for Ambient and Experimental Music - In-Depth Review

#### Collision Devices Crushturnal

<DemoWidget presetSlug="collision-devices-crushturnal" />

The Collision Devices Crushturnal can very well be the centerpiece of your ambient/experimental pedalboard. This unit gives you access to a digital delay, a sample reduction section, and a shimmer reverb, all routed to an onboard sequencer. If you can only buy one pedal, this one would probably be your best choice.

You can use the Crushturnal’s delay and reverb to get any kind of ambience, from classic slapback echo to warped textures, but things take a turn to the unexpected when you bring in the sequencer: this feature will automate the “Clock” parameter according to the step size you choose, and there are several different modes of automation to choose from.

At its core, the Crushturnal feels less like an effect and more like an instrument. It pushes you to play differently, to lean into the unexpected, and to find sounds you probably wouldn’t stumble on with a more traditional setup.

#### OBNE Beam Splitter

<DemoWidget presetSlug="old-blood-noise-endeavors-beam-splitter" />

The OBNE Beam Splitter is another all-in-one solution for ambient/experimental pedalboards. It’s a combination of three overdrive circuits running in parallel, plus a built-in delay that lets you double or triple-track your signal and even create chorus-like textures.
Of course, the Beam Splitter has many tricks up its sleeve, and the more you dive deep into this pedal the weirder things get. You can blend the three channels to build a massive wall of sound, or split them out individually to different amps and pedals for even wilder setups.
With the delay and Deviate controls, it shifts from subtle movement to unpredictable, warbly chaos. It’s the kind of pedal that rewards experimentation and keeps surprising you the more you play with it.

#### Mojo Hand FX Octaverse

<DemoWidget presetSlug="mojo-hand-fx-octaverse" />

The Mojo Hand FX Octaverse boasts a simple and user-friendly layout, but builds on a very unique concept: a reverse octave delay with a selectable high/low octave switch. This kind of effect was, previously, usually only found on higher-priced, multi-function pedals.
With the Octaverse, though, you get that same experimental sound in a straightforward stompbox that’s easy to dial in. The ability to shift the repeats either an octave up or down opens the door to some truly eerie textures, and when combined with the long, fading feedback, it can turn even a single note into a swirling pad.
Although less versatile and more niche-oriented than some other options on the list, the Octaverse is a no-fuss pedal that can add a fresh and original dimension to an ambient setup.

#### Demedash Effects T-120 Deluxe

<DemoWidget presetSlug="demedash-effects-t-120-dlx-v2" />

The Demedash Effects T-120 Deluxe is a unique delay pedal that, as weird as it sounds, pays homage to the VHS tapes of the past. According to Demedash, it was inspired by the thought “what if a Roland Tape echo sounded like a worn out wedding video from the early 90s?”. Surely enough, they were able to bring this
concept to life perfectly.

As you might’ve guessed, this pedal has a lo-fi edge to it. It’s packed with features such as tap tempo, selectable subdivisions, and echo trails that can be turned on or off. You can go from subtle, nostalgic shimmer to chaotic, self-oscillating textures really fast. The stereo outputs also help to add an extra sense of space.

What’s really nice about this pedal, though, are the modulation controls. With four dedicated modulation knobs, you can sculpt the depth, rate, sharpness, and randomness of the modulation however you like, giving you full control over the character of your delays. This means a single note can turn into a slowly shifting pad, a swirling vibrato, or even an unpredictable cascade of pitch-bent repeats.

#### Old Blood Noise Endeavors BL-44

<DemoWidget presetSlug="old-blood-noise-endeavors-bl-44-reverse" />

The OBNE BL-44 is a reverse delay with a built-in clock slider that interacts with the Speed knob in unique ways the more you explore different settings. This pedal’s concept might be similar to the Octaverse, but the BL-44 leans fully into the reverse side of things.
While the Octaverse mixes octave shifts with delay, the BL-44 constantly plays your signal backward, letting you create eerie swells and unpredictable layers. Adjusting the Clock and Speed knobs can take you from tight, almost playable reverse repeats to slow, warped washes.
It’s simple to use, but the sounds it produces can be completely wild since this unit is constantly sampling your input and playing it back in real time.

#### Old Blood Noise Endeavors Pardner Fuzz

<DemoWidget presetSlug="old-blood-noise-endeavors-pardner-fuzz" />

Moving into fuzz territory, we have the OBNE Pardner. The Pardner isn’t your typical run of the mill fuzz: it’s something completely unique and with a personality all its own.

Unlike standard fuzzes, the Pardner leans into synth-like textures that can shimmer and resonate in completely unexpected ways. The built-in Lasso overdrive loop adds another layer of sonic chaos, letting you push the fuzz even further or run other pedals through it for wild, experimental sounds.

With controls for tone, intensity, and fuzz character, plus the ability to toggle the Lasso routing, Pardner encourages you to break the usual rules—whether you’re shredding a solo, laying down massive chords, or even processing drums. It’s a fuzz that rewards curiosity and experimentation.

#### Catalinbread Soft Focus Deluxe

<DemoWidget presetSlug="catalinbread-soft-focus-deluxe" />

The Catalinbread Soft Focus Deluxe is a reverb powerhouse based on a patch from the Yamaha FX500 rack unit, a staple among shoegazers. It expands on the preset by adding extra parameters and fine control over this iconic modulated and harmonic reverb.
With the Deluxe version, Catalinbread didn’t just recreate the classic sound, but gave it room to grow. You get full control over reverb, modulation, octave, and delay, along with a built-in distortion circuit that can run in series or parallel with the main patch.
This means you can move from shimmering, orchestral tones to walls of saturated noise without ever leaving the pedal. For anyone chasing that massive shoegaze ambient sound, the Soft Focus Deluxe offers a complete toolkit in one compact box.

#### Walrus Audio Slöer

<DemoWidget presetSlug="walrus-audio-sloer" />

The Walrus Audio Slöer is a multi-texture stereo reverb that builds on its smaller, popular version Slö. This unit offers five heavily-modulated and dreamy reverb modes that are perfect for ambient swells and pads, all paired with a multitude of unique parameters.

On top of the classic Dark, Rise, and Dream modes, the Slöer adds Rain and Light, expanding its palette from murky, octave-down washes to bright, shimmering textures. The modulation section is just as deep, with five selectable wave shapes that let you fine-tune how the trails move and breathe.

Add in stereo width control, sample rate adjustment, and onboard presets, and you’ve got a pedal that can give your tone subtle depth or full-on cinematic soundscapes.

### Bonus Tips for Building an Ambient/Experimental Pedalboard

- Think in Layers, Not Just Effects: Instead of piling everything on at once, treat each pedal as a layer in the overall texture. A subtle delay before a huge reverb can sound bigger than stacking multiple reverbs.
- Use Stereo Whenever Possible: Many ambient pedals shine when run in stereo. Splitting your signal into two amps or channels creates depth and movement that you just can’t get in mono.
- Experiment With Pedal Order: Try placing fuzz before reverb for massive walls of sound, or modulation after delay for some unique textures.
- Leverage Expression and MIDI: Expression pedals, tap tempo, and MIDI mapping can unlock a lot of performance options, letting you morph sounds in real time instead of setting and forgetting.
- Leave Room for Silence: Sometimes the most effective “effect” is space. Don’t be afraid to let trails fade out and breathe before bringing in the next wave of sound.

### Conclusion

Ambient and experimental music thrives on exploration, and the right pedals can open endless doors for creativity. Crank a delay, twist a modulation knob, stack a fuzz into a reverb: some combinations will surprise you, some will flop, but that’s where the fun is.

Don’t be afraid to break the “rules” of pedal order or signal chain, as sometimes the strangest setups create the most interesting textures. Take your time, experiment with subtle tweaks, and let the pedals interact with each other. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s making your sound truly yours.
