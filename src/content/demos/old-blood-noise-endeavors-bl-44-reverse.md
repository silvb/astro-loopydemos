The BL-44 Reverse by Old Blood Noise Endeavors is a reverse delay pedal that can create a wide range of sounds, from subtle reverse echoes to glitchy, lo-fi textures.

To me, the BL-44 is the shoegazer's dream! There are a few genius design choices that make this stand out. The control set is super simple and stripped down, yet it brings so much enjoyment to experiment with.

The **SPEED** and **CLOCK** knobs are very interactive. You can create simple reverse delays, go an octave up or down, introduce glitchy artifacts, do long swells or bouncy, fairy-like textures.

The **MIX** knob is obvious and I'm just keeping that at around 2 o'clock to get a good balance of dry and wet signal.

The **VOLUME** knob seems to give us unity gain at around noon. If you crank it and go into an amp that's already breaking up, you can get some really cool, lo-fi textures.

The BL-44 is truly inspiring to play. I could not stop playing when I recorded the demo track and I'm for sure putting this on my pedalboard.

### Signal Chain

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups â€“ both pickups in series mode. This gives a thicker and more compressed tone which fit the lo-fi vibe of this pedal perfectly.
- BL-44 Reverse
- [Mixwave Benson Chimera Plugin\*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/B0N2PL)
- A bit of room-like reverb from the [Valhalla Vintage Verb plugin](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-vintage-verb/)
