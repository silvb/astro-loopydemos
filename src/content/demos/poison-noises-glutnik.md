The Glutnik by Poison Noises is a unique take on the Russian Big Muff Fuzz.

my favorite part about the Glutnik is that it doesn't really feel like a Big Muff when you explore some of it's extra toggles and knobs. Just choosing different options for diodes, bypassing the tone stack and applying the "wrong" bias gives this a whole different vibe.

It reminds me more of a gnarly, fuzzy preamp. Which I absolutely enjoy.

If you're tired of playing the same old Big Muff clones, give this one a whirl.

### Recording Notes

**Guitar**

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (bridge pickup)
- Glutnik
- [Strymon Iridium (chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

**Overdubs**

- Stellarosa in different pickup positions
- Glutnik with various settings
- [OBNE Screen Violence](/demos/old-blood-noise-endeavors-screen-violence) (just the modulated reverb) for the solo part in mono

**Bass**

- JMJ Fender Mustang, La Bella flats, played with pick, tone 100%, mute foam on the bridge
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) to even it out
- [MAE Line Blur](/demos/mask-audio-electronics-line-blur)
- Strymon Iridium (round) [with bass cabs](/posts/strymon-iridium-bass-ownhammer-ir/)
- SoundToys Radiator plugin for even more ooomph

**Drums**

- Logic Drummer Zak (garage rock) on the Motown Revisited+ kit
- Softube Saturation Knob plugin

- Compression from the Logic compressor plugin (Vintage FET)

The whole mix was "mastered" with exciter, limiter and mild compression in the DAW.
