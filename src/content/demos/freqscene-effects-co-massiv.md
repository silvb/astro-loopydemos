Massiv is a Hiwatt amp-in-a-box overdrive pedal with an internal boost section.

Massiv's preamp section is designed after that of early 70's Hiwatt DR103 amps.

Unfortunately, I have no personal experience with real Hiwatt amps. However, based on what I know from friends and the internet, they have a high headroom and are not easy to break up.

I think the Massiv is emulating that because it feels "stiff" to break up, but in a good way. When you engage the internal boost, it seems like it's fighting with the preamp to saturate it.

My favorite feature the internal output transformer, which adds a super pleasing sag like a proper amp does.

The 3-band EQ seems to be 3 passive filters that add a more subtle tone-shaping capability. This makes it usable across the whole range.

The boost can be before or after the preamp section and it can be clean boost or a dirty boost.

This all makes Massiv a great always on pedal â€“ ideal for stacking with other drives and also standalone as a 2-channel amp emulation.
