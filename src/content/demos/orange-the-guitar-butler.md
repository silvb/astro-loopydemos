The Orange Guitar Butler is one of those pedals that gives you a complete rig in a box – and it actually delivers on that promise. With its dual-channel design featuring a vintage-voiced clean channel and a JFET dirty channel, this preamp covers everything from pristine cleans to classic British overdrive territory. The 18V power supply gives it serious headroom, so both channels stay articulate and punchy even when pushed hard.

What really sets the Guitar Butler apart is its thoughtful control layout. The clean channel stays simple with gain and a three-band EQ, making it perfect for pedal stacking or just adding some sparkle to your tone. The dirty channel is where things get interesting – you get presence, two footswitchable master volumes for rhythm/lead switching, and that same three-band EQ. The JFET circuitry responds just like a tube amp, cleaning up beautifully when you roll back your guitar's volume knob.

The real versatility comes from its multiple outputs. There's an unbalanced output for hitting a power amp or your amp's return, plus a balanced XLR with cab simulation for going direct to the PA or your recording interface. The effects loop lets you place time-based effects after the preamp section, and the ground lift switch prevents those annoying earth loops when running multiple outputs. It's genuinely useful both on stage and in the studio.

I love how the Guitar Butler nails that classic Orange character without being pigeonholed into just one sound. The clean channel is surprisingly lush and works great with both single-coils and humbuckers, while the dirty channel covers blues, classic rock, and even some eighties metal territory. It's not going to give you modern high-gain sounds, but for everything else, it's a remarkably complete solution that could easily be your entire rig.
