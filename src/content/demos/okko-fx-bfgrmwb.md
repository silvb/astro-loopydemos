BFGRMWB by OKKO FX is the be-all and end-all of your search for the perfect Russian Big Muff recreation.

BFGRMWB stands for **B**ig **F**at **G**reen **R**ussian **M**uff **W**ith **B**enefits.

It is meticulously tuned to an original vintage Bubble Font Big Muff but has all the niceties you'd expect from a modern boutique pedal.

OKKO FX made sure to build the BFGRMWB with high quality components. Just plugging in patch cables is so satisfying. The foot switch also has the perfect sweet spot of clickyness but with a light pressure point.

To make this Muff really usable for studio and live situation, there are some added controls to sculpt the sound.

Russian Muffs have a little less of a mid scoop than most other Muffs, but we get an additional **MID RANGE** control to shape this even further.

The **RUMBLE** knob controls how much bass enters the pedal. Fully open resembles the stock setting of original vintage units and is great for bass and for going into already driven amps. Turn it back to tighten the sound for high headroom amps.

**PRESENCE** gives you extra control over the sizzle. This way you can make this fit for an already treble-y rig or add presence to the mix if needed.

OKKO FX makes them in batches, so go check the links below and get one, 'cause you're not getting mine!
