Dark Father Preamp by VVco Pedals is a versatile gain staging tool that offers an wide range of sounds.

It offers a 3-band EQ, multiple clipping options, boost, fuzz, distortion, light to medium to high gain overdrive, transparent boost... and all of that in a super unique enclosure.

There is a little bit of a learning curve to finding the sounds that you want from the Dark Father.

But with some tinkering and just trying all of the options in their numerous combinations, there are some sonic gold nuggets hidden in this box.

I really like the higher gain sounds that – to me at least – are very reminiscent of Josh Homme's (Queens of the Stone Age) guitar sound.
