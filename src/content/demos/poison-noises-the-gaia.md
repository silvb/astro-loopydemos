The Gaia by Poison Noises is K-style overdrive, but it's not just your average Klon clone.

Just like all Poison Noises creations, there is a multitude of well thought-out options packed into a small package.

I don't know if the Gaia has the magical diodes. But I know that with the **Quake** toggle, you have 3 different choices for diodes and they all sound nice. With the **Terraform**, you can switch between different clipping modes. I assume they are symmentrical/op-amp clipping/asymmetrical.

Usually, the gain knob on normal K-style drives determines the clean/drive mix. Here, you get a separate mix knob with the **Preserve** knob and an additional gain control with **Erupt**.

A lot of people recommend K-style drives as glorified dirty boosts. The Gaia can certainly do that, but as you can hear in this demo, it can do a lot more.
