The Keto by Ground FX is combination of chorus, reverb and a powerful preamp.

I love how simple the controls are designed. There is just RATE and DEPTH for the chorus modulation, ROOM adjusts the reverb mix and LEVEL controls the output volume.

What was most surprising for me was the preamp section. It has a lot of gain on tap. In the demo loop, you can here it slamming the frontend of the [MAE Line Blur](/demos/mask-audio-electronics-line-blur), which I chose because I like how it breaks up when pushed hard â€“ kinda like a console preamp.

This, in combination with the chorus and reverb, makes it an interesting choice for shoegaze tones. You can easily breakup any gain stage that comes after it and flush with modulation and reverb.
