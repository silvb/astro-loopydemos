The Norrsken by Electric Love is squishy, compressed fuzz based on **Carlin Compressor** – a rare swedish guitar pedal from 1970s.

In collaboration with Jamie Stillman from EarthQuaker Devices, that circuit was resurrected, reinterpreted and became the Norrsken.

While being labelled as "fuzz", this is a pretty tame gain pedal. If I hadn't read the manual, I'd call it an overdrive/compressor – but a friggin' sweet one.

As you can hopefully hear in the demo widget above, this pedal does that 2000s Garage Rock tone very well.

With its powerful 3-band EQ (especially the _MIDDLE_ control has a lot of effect), you can shape this tone to your liking.

The Norrsken has this chewy, saturated feel that is very pleasing to play with and it records excellently.

Electric Love's mission is to help fund ongoing breast cancer research. All profits made from Norrsken sales will be donated directly to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF).

So if this pedal is something that's up your alley, go pick one up and get extra Karma points on top!
