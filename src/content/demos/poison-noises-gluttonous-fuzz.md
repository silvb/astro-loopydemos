The Gluttonous Fuzz by Poison Noises is a unique fuzz with tasty textures.

I cannot quite put my finger on what the topology is behind this fuzz. It feels like a love child of a Big Muff and Fuzz Face â€“ inheriting the best of both fuzz types.

Whatever it is, I really like it. While being totally capable of producing heavy riff sounds, the Gluttonous Fuzz just gives off this cozy, warm vibe without being muddy. It reminds me one of my favorite bands: _Pity Sex_. A thick sounding fuzz that feels like coming home.
