The Skipping Stone by Poison Noises is a versatile delay with some wild modulation options.

The architecture of the Skipping Stone is very similar to the one of [The Spill](/demos/poison-noises-the-spill).

You get the standard delay controls like rate, feedback and mix. **Spin** is a rotary knob that let's you choose between 8 different delay types:

1. Digital
2. Double
3. Trem
4. Oil Can
5. Phaser
6. Pitch
7. Ring Mod
8. Dream

The **Splash** knob controls a different parameter depending on the delay type.

If normal delay is too boring for you, try the Skipping Stone.

### Recording Notes

**Guitar**

- K'mo Memphis Std., classic T-style pickups (neck pickup)
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) with medium high compression
- Skipping Stone
- [Strymon Iridium (Chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

**Stereo Pixi Dust**

- just grabbed the [Chase Bliss MOOD](/demos/chase-bliss-audio-mood), used the main guitar track as a basis and recorded a bunch of micro loops and pitch reverse delays while twisting the clock control to taste.
- Added some more ambience with the [Walrus Audio Sl√∂](/demos/walrus-audio-slo)
- Panned all the tracks wildly left, right and center to create a stereo background
- Mixed and bounced to one stereo track
- Applied compression and a low-pass filter to smooth it out and put it in the background

**Bass**

- JMJ Fender Mustang, played with fingers, tone 100%, Fender flats
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini)
- Strymon Iridium (round) [with bass cabs](/posts/strymon-iridium-bass-ownhammer-ir/) with medium gain

**Drums**

- GarageBand Drummer Anton (modern hip-hop)
- Roland CR-78 drum machine (GarageBand stock plugin)
- Touch of reverb, drive and compression, all from the stock plugin

The whole mix was "mastered" with exciter, limiter and mild compression in the DAW.
