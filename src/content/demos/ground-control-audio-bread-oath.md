The Ground Control Audio Bread Oath is the correct choice when you need a low to mid gain overdrive that has sparkle and clarity.

I've been using it a lot lately for recording to just act as my "cleanish" guitar sound. It adds the right amount of attack, compression and saturation. The guitar has no trouble standing out in a mix.

The Bread Oath does what Klons and TubeScreamers are supposed to do, but in a much more pleasant way that doesn't muffle the sound and without adding that nasal, honky voice.

It's been a great recording tool and with the foot-switchable boost circuit, probably a very useful drive pedal for gigging and rehearsing.
