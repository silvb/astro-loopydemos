the EF-P2 Spring Reverb by Echo Fix gives you a real physical reverb tank in pedal format.

You can fine-tune the reverb tail with a 2-band EQ with **BASS** and **TREBLE**. Adjust the sensitivity with the **SPRING DRIVE**. Bypass the dry signal completely with a separate foot switch.

Aside from the tweakability, this spring verb just sounds freaking great. In this demo, I'm focusing on my favorite spring reverb sound: running into an already driven amp.

While I'm certainly no Jack White, I think the EF-P2 with some juice on the amp get's you well inside the ball park of his sound.

### Signal Chain

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Custom with Mojo Lipstick pickups (bridge pickup)
- [Champion Leccy The Divvy](/posts/harmonic-percolator-shootout) for some extra crunch
- EF-P2 Spring Reverb
- [Mixwave Benson Chimera Plugin*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/B0N2PL), running a little hotter than usual to really bring out that surfy sound of a spring reverb going into an overdriven amp
- A bit of room-like reverb from the [Valhalla Vintage Verb plugin](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-vintage-verb/)
