The Honker Canadian Overdrive is another high quality build by TL Pedals. The Honker is a take on the classic TubeScreamer circuit.

There are a few modifications that transform this pedal into one that TS-haters like myself can actually enjoy:

- The mid-hump is less pronounced
- The tone control sweep is more usable
- The gain range is larger for the classic TS clipping: cleaner cleans and dirtier drives
- There are 3 clipping options (from left to right): classic TS asymmetrical clipping, no clipping and "crunch style" clippling

The design choices for the Honker definitely remind me of the [EarthQuaker Devices Plumes](/demos/earthquaker-devices-plumes). But the Honker has its own unique sound and feel.

My favorite setting on a lot of those pedals with clipping options seems to be bypassed clipping, meaning all distortion is coming from the OpAmp. It just has this nice thumpy oomph and a very robust sparkle to it.

I'd recommend the Honker Overdrive to anyone sceptic towards TS-style pedals. It's versatile, well built, has ample amounts of volume and just sounds and feels great.
