The Shallow Water by Fairfield Circuitry is a modulation pedal that get's a lot of hype around the internet. And I can totally see why after plugging it in.

Most people might think of it as a fancy chorus and vibrato pedal. But it's more than that. It's a vibe machine for lo-fi and nostalgic sounds. It creates very musical movement in your sound and adds a lot of character that other modulation pedals don't offer.

There is of course some technical reasons behind why that is so, most probably that this is a _k-field modulator_. I'm not expert enough to explain what that means. Feel free to check out the manual from [Fairfield Circuitry's website](https://fairfieldcircuitry.com/products/shallow-water) to get the nitty gritty details.

From just twiddling with the knobs a lot, here's what makes the Shallow Water so special to my ears:

- Random modulation. Instead of predictable modulation with some kind of waveform, the modulation is randomized and thus feels more "interesting".
- The LPG knob (low pass filter and gate circuit). In short: If you play louder, the low pass filter opens up and the sound gets brighter (and a little noisier which gives it even more lo-fi vibes). If you play softer, the signal darkens and sounds more muffled. Turning up the LPG knob increases the sensitivity to your playing dynamics.
- The damp control. It controls the slope of the pitch modulation. This is different than just modulation intensity (controlled by the depth knob). Rather, this controls the softness/hardness of the modulation. That's why you can dial in sweet and lush chorus sounds with the Shallow Water as well as seasick vibrato swirls.

Also, I have to gush about the build quality and design a bit: No video demo quite captures how nice this pedals feels in your hands. The choice of knobs, how the aluminum enclosure is polished (from a distance, it just looks like raw aluminum, but it's much nicer up close), the foot switch that feels soft but still has a little click to it and the status LED that turns on with a slight ease effect instead of just being abruptly on.

I can wholeheartedly recommend the Shallow Water if you're into lo-fi and ambient sounds or you want your bandmates to turn their heads during practice and have them ask _"What is that?!"_.
