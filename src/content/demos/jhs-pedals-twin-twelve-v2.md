One of my favorite guitar players of all time is Jack White. And the JHS Twin Twelve is the perfect little amp in a box to get those Silvertone-like sounds.

The JFET circuit of this pedal provides a very organic sounding overdrive. I really like how this captures the lo-fi kinda crunch you get from a cranked Silvertone amp (at least what I heard from White Stripes records and live performances).

The treble and bass controls are active controls just like the ones you would find on the original amp. Turning them clockwise adds treble and bass. The overall tone of the Twin Twelve sounds to me a bit mid-scooped, with a push in the low mids.

Like many [JHS dirt pedals](/demos/jhs-morning-glory-v4), the Twin Twelve V2 has a toggle to switch between a clean and a dirt channel that can also be triggered via their Red Remote Switch.

On the clean channel, the drive knob does nothing and the pedal becomes a boost and tone shaper.

When you flip the dirt switch, the pedal goes from slight breakup to raunchy cranked amp. The Twin Twelve is definitely not a high gain pedal. In the demo above you might notice that setting the drive to zero on the dirt channel silences the pedal completely (paired with the volume set to 9 o'clock).

The one thing I would change about the Twin Twelve is how the clean and dirt channels are set up. It would be nice if the clean channel had a little gain and the drive knob could go from clean to edge of breakup. And the dirt channel could use just a little more gain for my ears.

Overall, I think the Twin Twelve sounds great. Especially paired with a Gretsch, I felt like I should only wear red, white and black while playing it.
