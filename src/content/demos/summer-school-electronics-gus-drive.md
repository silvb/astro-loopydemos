The Gus-Drive by Summer School Electronics is a wonderful take on the classic distortion/overdrive topology based on the DOD 250.

This is my first time playing a 250-style drive, so I can't tell you how it compares with the original. According to Summer School Electronics, it's a modded 250 with more output, compression and a few other little tweaks.

Whatever tweaks were done to the circuit, this thing rips. At higher gain settings, it comes close to a RAT-type distortion, but with more clarity and punch. At lower gain settings, it feels like a recording console preamp that is working extra hard.

### Recording Notes

**Guitar**

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (bridge pickup)
- Gus-Drive
- [Strymon Iridium (chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

**Overdubs**

- Stellarosa with different pickup configurations
- Most parts double tracked and hard-panned left and right
- Overdubs in the first half of the loop are:
- [Catalinbread Soft Focus](/demos/catalinbread-soft-focus), mix about 50% and tamed decay into ...
- Gus-Drive
- [Walrus Audio Polychrome](/demos/walrus-audio-polychrome) and [Sl√∂](/demos/walrus-audio-slo) used selectively to add movement and space

**Ambient Pad**

- I used the the D.I. signal form the main guitar track and reamped it to the following chain:
- [Catalinbread Soft Focus](/demos/catalinbread-soft-focus) Reverb, fully wet
- [Walrus Audio Polychrome](/demos/walrus-audio-polychrome)
- Gus-Drive
- Iridium

**Bass**

- JMJ Fender Mustang
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) to even it out
- Gus-Drive, unity volume and gain cranked. Works surprisingly well on bass.
- Strymon Iridium (round) [with bass cabs](/posts/strymon-iridium-bass-ownhammer-ir/)
- Mixed with some D.I. signal, low-passed, to recover some bass frequencies.

**Drums**

- GarageBand Drummer Gavin (indie rock) on the Brooklyn kit
- Kick and snare treated with the stock GarageBand RAT-style pedal plugin

The whole mix was "mastered" with exciter, limiter and mild compression in the DAW.
