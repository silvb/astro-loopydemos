The Arigato by Caroline Guitar Company is phaser and vibrato with nostalgic vibes.

Arigato can do the swooshy modulation everybody expects from a phaser. Typical for Caroline Guitar Co., the choices for the knob controls are simple, yet clever and unique. You can either really fine tune the phaser "feel" with AIM and FEEDBACK.

You can make it super whacky when you switch to the rectangle waveform.

One of my favorite sounds is with the MOD toggle down (asymmetrical filter notches). It makes the modulation sound a bit more random. Pair that with the MIX knob all the way up and you've got yourself a really nice warbly cassette-type vibrato.

I really like the whole concept and design of the Arigato. It's just a very good phaser and it's easy to dial in a beautiful phaser sound. But it offers more depth if you spend time with it as it rewards exploration.
