The Naga Viper by Catalinbread is a modern interpretation of the classic Rangemaster Treble Booster.

You get all the vintage mojo that your heart desires from classic Treble Boosters red-lighting an amp. Naga Viper expands on this sound and gives you an attenuation control. **ATTN** controls how hot your guitar signal is hitting the pedal.

**BOOST** controls the output volume and **HEAT** is Naga Viper's internal gain knob. You can transform it into a dirty boost.

**RANGE** limits how much bass frequencies are allowed into the circuit. This is basically what makes Treble Boosters characteristic. The treble frequencies are perceived as boosted because the pedal filters out bass frequencies and then boosts the signal. By turning down **RANGE** and allowing more bass frequencies to pass, Naga Viper becomes more of a full-frequency "transparent" boost.

Naga Viper hits that sweet spot between nailing a specific, sought-after sound and being adaptable enough to be a modern, full-featured clean to dirty boost.
