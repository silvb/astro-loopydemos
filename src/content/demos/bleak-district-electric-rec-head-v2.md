The Rec Head V2 by Bleak District Electric is a simple but very creatively and elegantly designed lo-fi modulation device.

The modulation is affected by your playing dynamics. Pick harder and the tape modulation gets more intense. With a softer attack, you just get a nice lo-fi warble.

The SENSITIVITY knob controls how out of wack the modulation gets. The CHARACTER knob controls the tape saturation of the cassette recorder emulation.

KILL DRY toggles between fully wet mode and a mix of unaffected dry signal and modulated signal. TAPE RETURN controls the output volume of the modulated signal. In full wet mode, this just controls your overall volume and can act as a slight boost. In wet/dry mode, this basically becomes a mix knob that lets you dial in a cassette tape-like chorus.

I really like how cleverly simple the user interface is designed. The filtering and saturation captures the lo-fi cassette recorder super well. And I love that I can really play with picking dynamics and basically control the modulation with my playing.
