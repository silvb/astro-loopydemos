The Buzzing Bugs Audio Devices BB01 Fuzz Pre-Amp is a no-frills dirt machine.

I like it with the tone control pretty open, so you get that roaring, buzzing fuzz that cuts through in a mix. But you can certainly use it to tame wiry single coils.

The BB01 is a hybrid transistor/op-amp fuzz. To my ears, it feels like a fuzz face with some extra presence. So this feels like wielding a sonic broad sword but with some kind of magic extra precision.
