The Orange AD200 is one of those bass amps that just gets it right from the start. With four KT88 tubes pushing 200 watts through the simplest possible signal path, it delivers that deep, dynamic Orange bass tone without any unnecessary bells and whistles.

What I love about the AD200 is how responsive it feels under your fingers. The all-valve design reacts to your playing dynamics beautifully â€“ dig in hard and you get natural compression and harmonic saturation, play softly and it cleans up with surprising clarity. The three-band EQ is deceptively powerful, letting you dial in everything from pillowy sub-bass to aggressive midrange growl.

The Clean switch is brilliant for taming the front end when you want more headroom, especially with active basses that can easily overload the input stage. Both the active and passive inputs are properly voiced, so you're not fighting the amp to get your bass to sit right in the mix. The slave output is handy for recording or running additional cabinets.

This amp shines whether you're looking for warm, round tones that sit perfectly in a jazz trio or aggressive, saturated drive for heavier styles. It's not the most feature-packed bass head out there, but sometimes the best tool is the simplest one that just works every single time.
