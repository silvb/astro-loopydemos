The Deadman Fuzz Mk2 captures the gritty echoes of the Wild West in a wildly artistic package that's impossible to ignore.

Lateral Phonics built this around a silicon/germanium hybrid circuit using matched pairs of vintage transistors and NOS components. That unconventional mix of silicon and germanium creates a unique clipping structure that delivers creamy overdrive textures alongside rich, saturated fuzz tones. The carbon resistors and polyester film caps add to the authentic vintage character.

The control layout is refreshingly simple â€“ chicken head knobs for volume and low-cut, with the fuzz control sporting a distinctive silver witch's hat knob. That low-cut control is particularly useful, letting you trim muddiness while preserving those crucial high-mids that help the fuzz cut through a mix. The pedal's also highly responsive to your guitar's volume knob, cleaning up beautifully when you roll back.

What really sets the Deadman apart is its dynamic response and clarity. While it can absolutely deliver crushing wall-of-fuzz tones, it maintains punch and definition that keeps it from turning to mush. The hand-painted artwork with mismatched knobs and deliberate weathering gives it serious boutique character, though the momentary soft-touch bypass might take some getting used to if you're expecting a traditional stomp switch.
