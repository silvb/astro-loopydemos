The Fundamental Reverb by Walrus Audio is a simple, yet powerful reverb pedal.

It has three reverb modes: hall, plate, and spring. For each mode, you can control MIX, DECAY and TONE of the reverb trails.

Like all Fundamental Series pedals, this Reverb shoots for being the best in its price-range. If you're looking for a simple reverb that sounds great, this should be first on your list.
