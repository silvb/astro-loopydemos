Walrus Audio took my favorite reverb – the [Slö](/demos/walrus-audio-slo) – put even more sounds and features into it AND made it stereo… enter the Slöer!

Running the Slöer through its paces and bathing in all the stereo goodness kinda ruined me forever. I finally understand all the stereo fanatics.

From a recording and production standpoint, stereo reverb makes so much sense. There’s just more of a feeling of being in that space.

The expanded range of sounds is spot on. The LIGHT and RAIN mode complement the other 3 modes perfectly.

The STRETCH slider is great for "smearing" the reverb effects and make everything sound even more magic.
