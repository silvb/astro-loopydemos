When The Sun Explodes (WTSE) by Beautiful Noise Effects is the perfect marriage of distortion and reverb for shoegaze and noise rock sounds.

Reverb into distortion is quite the hype type of pedal right now, and the WTSE is a prime example of how to do it right. The reverb is lush and the distortion is thick and woolly on higher gain settings and clear and articulate on lower gain settings.

The voicings for the gain and reverb are very well matched. You get an instantly rewarding tone at any setting.

I think the WTSE is one of those pedals that strikes a nice balance between getting great sounds easily without knowing the ins and outs of the pedal, but also enough tweakability and nuanced features to make this your own.

I love how Beautiful Noise Effects design their pedals so that they cover a trendy sound but add that little innovative cherry on top. The tremolo on the momentary feedback is genius. I used this a lot for some background swells in the backing track of this demo. Plus, there is a foot-switchable boost that can be used to push the gain even more.
