The Twin Sonic MKII by OKKO FX is a brilliant dual channel overdrive, distortion, preamp and amp-in-a-box pedal.

I've been using this extensively lately to set up a nice warm amp-type sound with clarity and punch.

The Twin Sonic has a very pleasing breakup feel to it and the two sides work great together.

You can use both sides independently. Just keep in mind, the red side is designed to work especially well going into the blue side.

Blue can be described as bold, open and grainy. Red is slightly smoother and is perfect for adding some sweet harmonics to the punchy blue side.

VOICE is an interesting control. It changes the whole EQ characteristic of each circuit to go from open and wide to mid-focused and tight.

The Twin Sonic manages to be extremely versatile and useful to create just about any amp-like overdrive sound, while still being simple and intuitive in its user interface.
