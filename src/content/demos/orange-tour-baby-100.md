The Tour Baby 100 nails that classic Orange clean and crunch tone in a surprisingly compact head. At just over 10 pounds, this solid-state amp delivers 100 watts of power that feels much bigger than its pizza-box size suggests.

What makes this head special is its single-ended JFET preamp design instead of traditional tube stages. The clean channel features bass and treble controls plus a studio-grade VCA compressor that adds punch and sustain without the squash. The dirty channel captures that Orange edge-of-breakup character beautifully, with a footswitchable boost that pushes it into proper crunch territory.

I appreciate the practical features here: balanced XLR out, effects loop, and the ability to use the DI without a speaker load connected, and the whole thing comes with a quality gig bag. It's refreshingly straightforward compared to modeling ampsâ€”just two channels of pure Orange tone.

The Tour Baby 100 excels as a lightweight alternative to Orange's tube heads without sacrificing the core character. It's perfect for players who love Orange's sound but need something more portable and reliable for regular gigging. You won't get the exact tube saturation and dynamics, but you'll get consistent Orange punch that travels well.
