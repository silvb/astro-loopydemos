The Diablo Dual from OKKO FX makes you smile when you plug anything into it. It's a great low to mid gain overdrive for guitar and also bass.

The Diablo has a wonderful, chimey but chunky feel. With the unique set of controls DYN, FEED, BODY and TONE, this becomes an overdrive chameleon.

DYN controls the internal headroom of the gain section. You can either make it a well behaved, cleanish boost or a raunchy, raw overdrive that is on the verge of fuzz. Cranking the FEED knob helps with adding that fuzz-like character, because it controls how much low-end enters the circuit.

BODY controls the lows and low-mids and TONE tames or adds upper mids.

Considering it also has a second channel for fast switching of LEVEL and GAIN, this becomes a very versatile overdrive for studio and live use.
