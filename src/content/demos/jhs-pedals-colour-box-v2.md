The Colour Box V2 by JHS Pedals is a recreation of the famous 1073 Neve recording console preamp in pedal format.

It transforms your guitar signal and adds that vintage sparkle that you might recognize from records by Led Zeppelin, Spoon, Pink Floyd, David Bowie and countless more.

But it's more than just a one-sound-gimmick box. It's truly a swiss-army knife for recording. You can use it on vocals, bass, drums, keys, acoustic guitar... basically everything that makes a sound.

The powerful parametric EQ and the many ways to adjust it's internal gain staging make it a must-have for any studio â€“ no matter if it's your humble bedroom or professional fancy-schmancy production studio.
