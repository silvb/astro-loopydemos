The Tone Fox by Vaderin Pedals is an original overdrive/distortion circuit with a unique feel and control set.

We get the obvious **GAIN** and **VOLUME** controls and a special **TEETH** knob.

**TEETH** blends the clipping characteristics of the Tone Fox between a heavy, asymmetrically compressed feel and a less compressed, symmetrical distortion that offers more volume.

Inside the Tone Fox, there is a little trim pot that let's you adjust the bias of the transistor (IIRC). In practice, this makes the pedal sound and feel more or less gated. I adjusted my pedal to be a tad gated. It feels so satisfying to play!
