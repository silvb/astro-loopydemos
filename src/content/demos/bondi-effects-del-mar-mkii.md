The Del Mar by Bondi Effects is a deluxe treatment for all your low gain overdrive requirements.

Both modes (high/low headroom) make playing the guitar feel super satisfying under your fingers.

Flip the toggle up to get that squishy BluesBreaker feel. Flip it down to get a more focused, present tone that easily cuts through a mix â€“ like a Klon-style drive would.

I love that all Bondi drives have that flexible Baxandall EQ section, which means active boost/cut controls for treble and bass. This makes it very flexible to easily adjust to your setup. And again like the [Sick As](/demos/bondi-effects-sick-as-mkiii), it works on bass quite brilliantly.

The Del Mar gets you that puristic tone while being a unique, innovative circuit under the hood. And fair warning: you won't stop playing for a few hours when this thing is in your signal chain.
