The Orange Two Stroke is one of those pedals that does exactly what it says – it's a dual-parametric EQ and clean boost that gives you surgical control over your tone. Two frequency bands (Hi: 850Hz-8.2kHz, Lo: 120Hz-1.2kHz) with up to 18dB of cut or boost each, plus 12dB of clean boost via the **OIL** knob. 

Set **HI** and **LO** to noon and it's a totally neutral clean boost.

**OIL** controls the amount of clean boost (up to 12dB). Fully counter-clockwise is unity gain, which is a useful feature if you just want to tweak your EQ without adding volume. 

What makes this special is the internal charge pump that doubles your operating voltage to 18V, massively increasing headroom. You can power it with 9V or 12V for even more output, and it stays whisper quiet. The parametric EQ is incredibly precise – you can dial in subtle solo boosts or completely reshape your amp's voice.

The build quality is bulletproof with a protective roll-bar across the front and side-mounted jacks. It's bigger than most boost pedals, but that space houses serious circuitry. Works brilliantly before or after other pedals, or even in your effects loop for different tonal possibilities.

For players who want both clean boost and precise EQ control in one pedal, the Two Stroke delivers. It's perfect for adding that extra channel to your amp or fine-tuning your sound without coloring your core tone.
