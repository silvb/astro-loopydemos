The Mastotron by ZVEX Effects is an absolute sleeper of a fuzz pedal.

It's sub-heavy silicon fuzz with a few extras. The **PW** (Pulse Width) knob changes the waveform of the distortion. **RELAX/PUSH** is an input impedance control that can convert your passive pickups to line-level and vice versa.

My favorite sound from the Mastotron is this super satisfying velcro fuzz. It cuts well through a mix, feel very full-bodied due to its sub-heavy nature, and has a very unique character.

ZVEX put the Mastotron circuit in a very unassuming and utilitarian enclosure, but don't let that fool you. This is a very versatile and powerful fuzz pedal.
