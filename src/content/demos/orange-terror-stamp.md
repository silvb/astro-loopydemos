The Orange Terror Stamp packs genuine Orange tone into a 20-watt hybrid amp pedal that punches way above its weight. It's got a proper 12AX7 tube driving the preamp with a solid-state power section, giving you authentic tube saturation where it counts most.

The controls are clever â€“ Volume 1 and Volume 2 with a footswitch to toggle between them. Set one for rhythm, one for lead, and you've got instant level switching. The Shape control goes from mid-forward (left) to scooped (right). I keep it around 10-11 o'clock for classic Orange bite.

At 20 watts, this gets surprisingly loud â€“ we're talking rehearsal or small gig volume, not bedroom practice. Clean tones are decent, but it shines in crunch territory with that signature Orange character: loose, grinding, and musical. It responds well to picking dynamics like a proper amp.

The effects loop is useful, and you can use just the FX return as a 20-watt power amp for pedalboards or modelers. The cab sim output works for recording or headphones but won't fool anyone â€“ use the FX send to a proper IR loader for critical work.

The Terror Stamp wants to be driven â€“ if you need pristine cleans, look elsewhere. But for Orange grind in a pedalboard format, it's hard to beat.
