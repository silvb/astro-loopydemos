The Fanclub by Freqscene Effects Co. is another genius device: a 4-in-1 boost pedal.

With the super satisfying rotary knob, you can flick between four different boost topologies. This makes it a very practical tool for recording and live situations.

- **Echoplex Preamp**: Lowest volume bump of all 4 types, but thickens up your tone. Great for jangly guitars that need a bit more body for certain parts.
- **Linear Op-amp Boost**: Based on the MXR Micro Amp. Just makes everything louder. Whenever I play live, a linear boost in front of an always-on drive or amp-in-a-box pedal is my favorite combo. This way you get a consistent sound for verse/rhythm and chorus/lead parts.
- **Treble Booster**: If you really need to cut through the mix or you want to tickle a dark sounding amp, this is the top choice. Also great for taming low-end with certain fuzzes. Try this in front of a Big Muff!
- **Electra Overdrive**: This is a dirty/fuzzy boost. If you really want your amp to sound blown out, boost it with this.
