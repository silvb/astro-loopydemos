The Dark Terror 15 nails that aggressive, saturated high-gain sound in a surprisingly compact tube head. Orange's highest-gain Terror amp ever, it packs 3 x ECC83/12AX7 preamp tubes and 2 x EL84 power tubes into a tiny 15-pound package that you can actually carry in one hand.

What makes this amp special is that deceptively simple Shape control – it's not your typical EQ knob. Turn it one way and you get scooped, modern metal tones with tight low-end. Turn it the other way and you're back in classic Orange territory with that punchy, mid-forward roar. The 4-stage preamp borrows tech from Orange's flagship amps, so you're getting proper high-end circuitry in a lunchbox format.

The 15/7-watt switching is genuinely useful for recording. At 7 watts, you can push those EL84s harder without destroying your neighbors, and the tube-driven effects loop keeps your pedals sounding warm even when the gain is cranked. The three output jacks (two 8-ohm, one 16-ohm) give you flexibility for different cab setups.

This isn't just a metal machine – though it excels at that. Clean and crunch tones are surprisingly good for such a high-gain focused amp. It's perfect for bedroom warriors who want legitimate tube saturation at reasonable volumes, or as a lightweight backup head for gigs.
