The Big Muff PI by Electro Harmonix provides the reference for the iconic sound of 90s grunge and alternative rock.

If you've seen any of my other demos, you know I love myself a piece of PI ðŸ˜‰

The knob layout couldn't be much simpler: volume, tone and sustain (a.k.a. distortion/fuzz level).

You will probably hear that the tone knob makes most sense around noon. You use that to adjust the tone to your amp and guitar. Bridge pickups and single coils tend to like 11 and 12 o'clock, while humbuckers and neck pickups prefer it past noon.

The sustain knob is usually set somewhere past noon. You will hear the biggest difference when turning the knob from zero to literally anything above that. Past noon, the audible differences are subtle and it becomes more of a "feel" thing. Under the fingers, the added sustain is more noticable.

I believe out of this pedal, you get one classic sound. It is not super versatile. And it doesn't have to be. The knobs are there to adjust for your rig and then you stomp on that big box and let it rip. That's how you're supposed to use it.

I love the obnoxiously big box made out of folded sheet metal. It's cheap but rugged and just feels rock'n'roll when you're on a stage and step on it.
