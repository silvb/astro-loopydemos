The Seamark Reverb Mk2 nails that dark, metallic spring reverb character in one of the most compact true spring units available. At just 5.6 x 3.7 x 1.8 inches, this thing packs an actual spring tank with all the mechanical charm that comes with it.

I enjoy the Seamark because it takes the classic surf-inspired spring reverb and turns it inside out. Instead of sunny beach tones, you get stormy atmosphere with noir shades and that signature metallic edge. The Level, Amount, Impact, and Tone controls give you serious range – from clean vintage spring to completely saturated chaos when you dig into the Impact knob.

The real magic happens with the Splash button, which maxes out the Impact setting for momentary bursts of spring overdrive. This isn't just a volume boost – it pushes the spring coil into oscillation and overdrives the JFET preamp stage, adding warmth and harmonics that glue the wet/dry mix together. You can even kick the pedal while holding Splash for bell-like tones that are surprisingly musical.

What sets the Mk2 apart is how thoughtfully designed it is for live use. All I/O and power moved to the top for pedalboard-friendly mounting, plus improved power filtering for quieter operation. The true bypass is soft and silent, and the hand-painted art gives each unit character. It's fully analog with no unnecessary digital artifacts – just pure spring tank goodness with enough control to go from classic to completely unhinged.
