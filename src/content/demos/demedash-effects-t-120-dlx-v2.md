The T-120 Videotape Echo Deluxe by Demedash Effects has been on my wishlist for quite a while.

I always loved analog bucket brigade delays, especially when the repeats get noticeably darker and when there's some modulation happening.

Well, the T-120 certainly has some noticeable modulation and sound alteration going on in the repeats.

My favorite setting is when the modulation get's glitchy and random and lo-fi but still subtle enough to be musical. But it's a very versatile delay that can go from cleanish analog delay to all-out wacky modulated whirlwind delay.

I have never heard how an old videotape would alter the sound of my guitar. But after playing the T-120, I'm pretty sure it would feel like this.

### Signal Chain

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (both pickups)
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) for medium compression
- Bondi Effects Del Mar Overdrive for very subtle saturation, compression and EQ (demo coming soon)
- T-120 DLX v2
- [Strymon Iridium (chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

I used the compressor and overdrive to keep the guitar as clean as possible – as not alter the sound of the delay repeats – while making the guitar stand out in the mix without being harsh.
