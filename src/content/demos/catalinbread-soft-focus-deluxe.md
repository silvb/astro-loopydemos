The Catalinbread Soft Focus Deluxe is an expanded version of the popular [Soft Focus](/demos/catalinbread-soft-focus) reverb.

The Soft Focus is based on a patch from a rack unit effect from the 80s, the Yamaha FX500. Famously used by the band _Slowdive_ for their 1993 record _Souvlaki_, this patch adds modulated reverb and sympathetic harmonies to your dry signal.

The Deluxe version expands on this concept and offers a wider variety of programs, fine-grail control, expression control, tap tempo and a blendable high-gain distortion circuit to this already great effect.

We get 6 differently voiced programs. PRGM 1 is based on the original Soft Focus patch, while the other 5 programs expand on the algorithm. You can pick from infinite reverb tails, deeper modulation, shimmer verbs, pitch delays and create lush swells with an external expression pedal.

I really like the distortion circuit. I feel it adds just the right kind of noise rock texture to the more ethereal side of this reverb.
