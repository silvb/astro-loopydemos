The 1991 by Funny Little Boxes is a distortion and overdrive pedal inspired by the guitar sounds of Pearl Jam's album _Ten_.

To be frank, I've never been a Pearl Jam fan and I'm not familiar with the album _Ten_. But I do like the sound of this pedal. To me, it just sounds like a really good Marshall-in-a-box pedal on steroids.

The voicing of the EQ and gain stages is just wonderful. On higher gain settings, you can get some of that chuggy feel without it ever getting muddy or boomy. The EQ is very responsive and allows you to dial in a wide range of tones.

Also, light overdrive tones deliver a warm, classic-rock type character that is very pleasing to the ear.

Add on top the cool design and great price point for a very versatile and great sounding overdrive/distortion. There's no reason not to check this one out.
