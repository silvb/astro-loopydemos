The Fundamental Distortion by Walrus Audio gives you three different RAT flavours in one box.

No unnecessary shenanigans to talk about here. Just like the pedal that inspired this classic distortion sound, we get VOLUME, TONE and GAIN controls.

The mode switch lets you choose between the three different clipping diode options: LED, Silicon and DARK. Silicon is the classic RAT sound, while DARK and LED sound more open. DARK to me is great for lower gain sounds, while LED gives you raw and punchy bite.
