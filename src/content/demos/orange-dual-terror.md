The Dual Terror nails that British tube tone in a compact 30/15/7-watt head that's perfect for both stage and studio. It's essentially two Tiny Terror front ends that you can switch between – one Fat channel for warmth and extra gain, plus the classic Tiny Terror channel for that raw, on-the-edge-of-breakup sound that Orange is famous for.

What I love about this head is how responsive it is to your playing dynamics and different guitars. With the gain backed off and volume up, you get surprisingly good clean tones with plenty of headroom before it starts to naturally compress into that sweet Orange crunch. Crank the gain up and you're in proper British overdrive territory that sounds way better than most pedals trying to do the same thing.

The power scaling is genuinely useful – you can drop from 30 watts down to 15 or 7 watts without losing that tube saturation, which makes it perfect for home recording or smaller venues. The dual channel setup means you can have a rhythm tone dialed in on one channel and a lead boost on the other, or balance between different guitars without constantly tweaking knobs.

At under 22 pounds with a padded gig bag included, the Dual Terror hits that sweet spot of being portable enough for regular gigging but serious enough to handle any stage. It's one of those amps that just makes playing guitar feel more satisfying – everything from pick attack to string resonance comes through with that unmistakable Orange character.
