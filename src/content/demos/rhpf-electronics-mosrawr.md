I'm excited to introduce you to the MOSRAWR, a fuzz pedal that RhPf Electronics, my wife Claudi ([@sketchypedals](https://www.instagram.com/sketchypedals/)) and I designed together.

Claudi designed the beautiful artwork that juxtaposes the fierce nature of the fuzz with her unique, whimsical style that gives you the feeling of having had too much cotton candy at the fair.

Thomas from RhPf Electronics handled the circuit design. We used the [Mosferatwo](/demos/rhpf-electronics-mosferatwo) as a basis and modified it heavily to create a fuzz that has a unique texture and feel.

The whole thing developed by Thomas sending me prototypes to try out and us talking about frequency responses, gain staging and finding that sweet spot between musicality and lo-fi aggression.

The Mosrawr delivers that satisfying velcro-fuzz texture that's become essential for modern garage rock and stoner rock. This isn't your typical wall-of-fuzz pedal - it's designed to feel alive, reactive, and surprisingly musical even when pushed into full saturation.

What sets the Mosrawr apart is how it handles dynamics and cleanup. Roll back your guitar's volume and you get chunky, gated overdrive that breaks up beautifully. Dig in hard and it roars with thick, sustaining fuzz that maintains clarity in the low end while delivering that trademark velcro tear on the top. The midrange push gives it serious cut, making it perfect for those Josh Homme-style desert rock riffs.

The pedal's circuit design focuses on movement and texture rather than just raw volume. You can feel how the fuzz structure evolves as you play - from crisp, articulate notes at lower settings to blooming, saturated walls when cranked. It stacks exceptionally well with other drives, acting as either a foundation fuzz or a final stage for maximum chaos.

For players chasing that QOTSA-meets-garage-punk sound, the Mosrawr hits the sweet spot between musical and aggressive. It's one of those rare fuzzes that you can actually use for songwriting, not just noise-making.
