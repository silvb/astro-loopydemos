The Fundamental Drive by Walrus Audio is the drive pedal that I wish was around when I started playing guitar.

All three modes have a unique texture and feel that can be easily dialed in to get a great drive sound.

The first thing to note is that the TONE control is a high-shelf knob. All the way to the right, it let's through all of the high-end. If you slide it to the left, you are shelving off the highs. I lean towards a bright sound, so for SMOOTH and CRUNCH mode, I tend to max out the tone slider.

The BRIGHT mode might be my favorite mode. It's chimey and it really cuts through the mix effortlessly. I turn down TONE on this mode to tame the highs so it doesn't become brittle or harsh.

CRUNCH has the highest gain range and lives on the edge of distortion/fuzz.

SMOOTH is really nice for warm low gain sounds. Also, I found this is a fantastic bass overdrive. The bass in the backing track is using the Fundamental Drive in SMOOTH mode.

If you can't get a pleasing overdrive sound out of this pedal, something else is wrong with your rig.
