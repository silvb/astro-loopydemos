The Fundamental Tremolo by Walrus Audio is a simple, yet powerful tremolo pedal.

It has three waveform modes (sine, square, and random step) and controls for RATE, DEPTH, and VOLUME.

What I always like to do with tremolo pedals is to push the volume a bit to "tickle" the amp periodically. That's what you'll hear a lot in the demo above.

I can't say I use tremolo a whole lot in my own music. However, I think the third waveform mode (random step) is a lot of fun to play with and a pretty clever idea for a tremolo.

You get glitchy and unpredictable patters as if the audio connection is unstable.

As with all pedals from Walrus Audio's Fundamental Series, the Fundamental Tremolo would be one of my first recommendations for anyone looking for the type of effect it provides.
