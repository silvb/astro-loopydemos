The Hall of Mirrors by Poison Noises is a reverb packed with all kinds of different flavors to spice up your ambient guitar soundscapes.

With the rotary knob **Replicate**, you can switch between 8 different reverb types. There are classic sounds available like room, hall and plate â€“ all of which are nicely adjustable with decay, pre-delay and low pass filter.

And typical for Poison Noises, there are creative and experimental sounds on the menu like phaser, tremolo, pitch, flanger and aliaser reverb. **Distort** and **Reflect** control different parameters depending on which reverb type is selected.

If you can't find a good sound in the Hall of Mirrors, you probably don't like reverb.
