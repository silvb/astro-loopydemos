The Fuzz Lands by Wonderful Audio Technology is a unique velcro fuzz with lots of character and toggles to fine-tune its texture.

I love how this is a well-crafted and cleverly designed fuzz. As you might able to discern from the demo, it doesn't really have a "wide range" of tones. Yet there are three toggles and a fuzz knob to tweak the sound.

And that's what's clever about it. It's not a fuzz that can do everything, but it's a fuzz that can do one thing really well. You will always hear the "Fuzz Lands" character at every setting.

The **FUZZ** knob is not meant to go from clean to fuzz, but rather from smooth to velcro.

The aptly named toggles **ROOT**, **EARTH** and **NATURE** change the feel and texture of the fuzz. All controls are interactive and affect each other in subtle ways.

If you are a fuzz cork sniffer, you won't be turning your nose up at this one.
