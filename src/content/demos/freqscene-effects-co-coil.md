The Coil by Freqscene Effects Co. delivers the kind of lead sound that I always gravitate towards with a bunch of pedals.

I love running reverbs, modulation and delay before heavy drive or distortion effect pedals. And the Coil does all that in one attractive package.

I like that this is not your typical wall-of-noise vacuum shoegaze sound, but a more controllable and very musical kind of chaos.

The time-based effect that is happening before it hits the drive section sounds like it's actually a delay with quick repeats. There is some detuning happening on the repeats which could be an LFO on the delay time to get that warbly lo-fi effect.

The dirt section has a lot of oomph. It's offers preamp-y console-like saturation which I really enjoy.
