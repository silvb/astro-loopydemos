The Colossus by Vaderin Pedals is a Tone Bender-inspired fuzz pedal that has all my favorite fuzz tones neatly packed into a sexy enclosure.

I knew that Vaderin regularly puts out nice looking and awesome sounding dirt boxes. But the Colossus is just the perfect fuzz I didn't know I was looking for all this time.

It leans toward a velcro-fuzz texture that is very pleasing to play and to hear. It has bite and clarity but feels massive in a mix.

The very first time I plugged into the Colossus for a quick test, I knew that this would be a great fuzz for a band and mix context. You have no trouble getting heard when the Colossus is on. At the same time, it's not unpleasantly harsh or abrasive.

The controls are not very heavy-handed and I would say that the Colossus is not necessarily a "versatile" fuzz. I think it centers around one very good sound that you can fine-tune to match your rig.

The **BASS** and **TOP** controls are cut controls. Turning them clockwise takes away bass or treble. I found these controls to be quite subtle. **BASS** is pre-gain, which means it's interactive with the **FUZZ** control.

Another thing I really like is that there is plenty of volume on tap. You can easily use the Colossus as a boost or to push your amp into overdrive. Unity gain seems to be around 11 to 12 o'clock on the **VOLUME** control.

I might go even so far to say that the Colossus is my overall favorite fuzz right now. Make sure to check it out!
