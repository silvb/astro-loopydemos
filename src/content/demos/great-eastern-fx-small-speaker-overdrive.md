The Small Speaker Overdrive by Great Eastern FX is an overdrive/preamp with a very satisfying feel to it.

It gives you those vibes of small studio amps that are great for tracking garage rock sounds.

The breakup feels very natural and – dare I say – "amp-like".

The ranges of the knobs are not too dramatic, giving you an opinionated, great overdrive sound that stacks really well.

There is literally no bad sound in this pedal.
