The Exploder by Beautiful Noise Effects is a distortion box extracted from the gain circuit of their distortion/reverb pedal WHEN THE SUN EXPLODES.

It has a powerful 3-band EQ and an envelope controlled white noise generator.

This is my first time playing a BNE pedal and I was blown away (pun intended) by the Exploder. I don't know this for certain but the distortion feels like it's based on something like a DOD 250 â€“ which I love!

The 3-band EQ makes this great for bass and guitar.

Initially, I was sceptic about the white noise part. But it's a really cool feature that can add a unique character to the overall sound.

It also sounds great at low gain but I feel it was designed to be cranked and probably used after a reverb pedal for some shoegaze action.

The Exploder will definitely stay around in my home studio for whenever I need higher gain distortion.
