The Dirty Little Secret Deluxe by Catalinbread is probably the best Marshall amp in a box pedal I've ever tried.

The response and feel is so three dimensional and amp-like, it's hard to believe it's a pedal.

Even if you're not after the super sweet, touch sensitive and rich Marshall tone, you get an ultra-versatile dual gain drive and distortion pedal.

I love how the DLS Dlx gets quite brash and aggressive but never harsh or fizzy. There is a chewyness to how it saturates that is just so satisfying and addictive to play.
