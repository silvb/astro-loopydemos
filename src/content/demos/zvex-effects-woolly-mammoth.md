The Woolly Mammoth by ZVEX Effects is a uniquely voiced fuzz pedal designed for bass.

You can check out my [bass distortion shootout](/posts/bass-distortion-shootout) if you wanna hear it in action and compare it to other bass fuzz/distortion pedals.

As Jack White would agree, though, the Woolly Mammoth is a beast of a pedal that can be used on guitar as well.

There is plenty of low end on tap. Paired with the veclro-y, gated texture and attack, this makes guitars sound very thumpy and full sounding.

The Woolly Mammoth feels like a mix of a Big Muff and a starved Tonebender, inheriting the best of both worlds.
