The Pedal Baby 100 is Orange's answer to the "where's my dynamics?" problem that plagues most solid-state power amps. This 100-watt class A/B unit weighs just 7 pounds but feels and responds like a proper tube power section, making it perfect for pedal platform rigs or modeler setups that need some real-world thump.

What sets the Pedal Baby apart is its class A preamp stage feeding that class A/B output section—it's not just clean power, it's musical power. The active bass and treble controls work more like depth and presence, giving you enough EQ flexibility to match your rig to any cabinet without getting surgical about it. At 12 o'clock they're neutral, but you've got plenty of cut or boost when you need it.

I love how this thing handles everything from clean ambient stuff to saturated leads without breaking a sweat. Unlike typical power amps that just make things louder, the Pedal Baby adds a subtle Orange character—nothing dramatic, just that familiar musical response that makes your pedals and preamps feel more alive. The voltage switch means it'll work anywhere, and at this size it fits in any pedalboard case.

For anyone running HX Stomp, Iridium, or analog preamp pedals who misses the feel of a real amp, this nails it. It's not trying to be a Swiss Army knife—it's just really good at being a power amp that doesn't suck the life out of your tone.
