The Alpha Haunt by Old Blood Noise Endeavors is a silicon high gain gated fuzz pedal.

This is the expanded version of the Haunt Fuzz. OBNE added extra controls: a 3-band EQ, an extra parallel boost via the **ENHANCE** knob and even more switches.

I was very drawn to the Haunt and Alpha Haunt because of its gated texture. Because, as you might know, I love [velcro fuzz](/posts/velcro-fuzz-shootout).

With all the extra EQ and gain staging controls, it's very easy to find a sound that fits your taste and setup.

I'm especially a fan of the 3-band EQ. With the **MIDS** slider, you can really dial in a characterful sound that get's heard in a mix, or boost the **LOW** for extra oomph or turn down **HIGH** too tame the high end.

No matter how you set the fuzz controls, the texture always seems satisfyingly velcro-y.
