The Fundamental Chorus by Walrus Audio is a simple, yet powerful chorus pedal. It has sliders to control the RATE, DEPTH and MIX of the chorus effect, and a toggle switch to select between three different voicings.

With the three modes, you can get emulations of simple, warm analog modulation or complex tri-chorus effects.

One of my favorite ways to use the Fundamental Chorus is to use the "simple" mode, MIX 100% and just a slow and subtle modulation to get some gooey vibrato tones.

### Signal Chain

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (both pickups)
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) into the [MAE Line Blur](/demos/mask-audio-electronics-line-blur). The slightly compressed and articulate tone fits the whole tune better and, in my opinion, makes it easier to hear the subtle differences of the chorus settings.
