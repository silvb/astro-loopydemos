The Germanium Fuzz by Benson Amps is the prettiest fuzz I've ever played.

It's a germanium fuzz face style fuzz with a few tricks up its sleeve. It is temperature regulated, meaning it will sound the same no matter the temperature of the room. It also has a pickup simulator with an impedance knob. This allows you to dial in sounds that you would normally only get with the volume on your guitar rolled down. And you can put it anywhere in your signal chain.

This fuzz often sounds more like an overdrive than a fuzz. On it's most extreme setting, it's still very responsive, dynamic and articulate. It's super musical and fun to play. I'd use it for anything between smooth lead lines and jangly, overdriven chord strummings.
