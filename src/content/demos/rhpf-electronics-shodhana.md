The Shodhana nails that sweet spot between transparent boost and mid-forward overdrive with just two knobs. RhPf Electronics designed this Swiss-made pedal around a clever parallel circuit that blends a clean MOSFET boost with increasing overdrive saturation as you turn up the Drive control.

At minimum Drive settings, you're getting a pristine, full-range boost that adds harmonics and snap without any coloration. Crank the Drive knob clockwise and the overdrive circuit takes over, shifting the frequency focus toward the mids while adding increasing grit and harmonic density. The transition feels natural and musical—never jarring or abrupt.

The two-knob simplicity is deceptive—there's real versatility here. The Level control gives you plenty of headroom for unity gain or boosted presence, while the Drive knob essentially morphs the pedal's character from sparkly boost to focused, expressive drive. It's the kind of pedal that enhances what's already there rather than imposing its own voice, making it a solid choice for players who want to retain their core tone while adding some extra definition and feel.
