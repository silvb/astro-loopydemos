The Meridian Time Modulator by Spaceman Effects is a flanger, vibrato, and chorus pedal. It's a very versatile pedal that can be used to create everything from subtle modulation to extreme effects.

I'm especially fond of the random modulation waveform and the interaction between the REGEN (feedback) and TIME (lag of the modulated signal). You can find unique sounds that are somewhat in between the stereotypical modulation sounds of flanger, vibrato, and chorus.

And there is just something about the analog sound that makes everything sound gooey and warm.
