If you like the [Bondi Sick As Overdrive](/demos/bondi-effects-sick-as-mkiii), but you wish it had more gain, more oomph and that it melts faces, the Sick As High Shredroom is for you.

Being a Sick As that basically goes to 11, there are a few similarities to the it's low gain sibling that give it the typical Bondi allure.

The characteristic headroom and clarity due to the internal boost to 18V is there, as well as the active BASS/TREBLE tone stack and the 2-way toggle switch for more open or compressed tones.

The High Shredroom never goes fully clean, but you're not turning this pedal on for that tone anyway.

This is just a superbly voiced distortion pedal. It's simple, the enclosure and graphics are beautiful as always, and it just oozes quality riffing.
