The Dyna Comp Bass nails that classic compression sound that made its guitar sibling legendary, but it's been thoughtfully tweaked for bass frequencies. It's one of those pedals that makes sense fastâ€”within minutes you'll dial in exactly what you need and get back to playing.

Built around the same CA3080 "metal can" integrated circuit as the original, the bass version adds some crucial controls that bassists actually need. The **Clean** blend lets you maintain that low-end integrity that often gets lost with compression, while the **Tone** control tweaks the upper midrange so your bass doesn't disappear in the mix. The **Attack** switch toggles between vintage slow attack and modern fast attack times, giving you control over how the compressor responds to your playing dynamics. Bonus: the fast attack mode also adds a touch of saturation that really helps you get closer to that Tame Impala, plucky bass sound.

What I love about the Dyna Comp Bass is how it evens out your signal without making everything sound squashed or lifeless. Whether you're holding long notes in a ballad or playing punchy funk lines, it keeps everything consistent while preserving the natural character of your bass. The mini format means it won't eat up precious pedalboard space, and at this size, it's honestly smaller than most power supplies.

The compression is musical and transparent when you want it to be, but push the **Sensitivity** and you can get into more aggressive territory. It works great as a subtle always-on effect to tighten up your sound, or as a more obvious effect for sustained lead lines. For bassists who've been curious about compression but intimidated by complex controls, this is an perfect entry point that delivers professional results.
