The Seesaw by Poison Noises is a surprising little pitch and vibrato noise machine.

When I initially set up my board for recording this demo, I took a quick glance at the description of the pedal and wanted to write some heavy octave riff with an aggressive fuzz behind it. I was reading the word "octave" and I did not imagine the wonderful weirdness that the Seesaw offers.

Even if its job is to throw your signal out of tune, it does it in a quirky but musical way.

You can use this as a faux chorus, add shimmer and/or body with octaves, introduce some weirdness with a heavily modulated fifth or throw the wet signal out of tune and add some ring and pitch modulation on top.

The Seesaw makes the most simple arpeggios sound interesting and artsy and I really love writing with it.
