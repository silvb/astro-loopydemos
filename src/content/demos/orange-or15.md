The OR15 by Orange nails that classic British valve amp character in a surprisingly compact 15-watt head. This little powerhouse is based on the dirty channel from Orange's flagship Rockerverb series, packing four stages of gain that can range from sparkly cleans to full-on saturation. Despite its small size, the OR15 is one of the loudest 15-watters you'll encounter – easily filling club stages with rich power amp overdrive.

What makes the OR15 special is its tube complement of 3 x 12AX7, 1 x 12AT7 preamp tubes, and 2 x EL84 power tubes running in Class A configuration. The gain structure is beautifully responsive to your playing dynamics, with clean tones that chime with British precision and overdrive that builds from gentle breakup to monstrously heavy saturation. The powerful 3-band EQ gives you plenty of tonal flexibility, while the all-valve effects loop maintains the tube character throughout your signal chain.

The OR15 features Orange's signature "pics only" faceplate design – those iconic hieroglyphs with no text, echoing the brand's early history. You can switch between 15 and 7 watts for studio use, though even at lower wattage this amp has serious volume on tap. The single-channel design keeps things simple and focused, making it a perfect foundation for players who prefer to shape their sound with pedals rather than amp channels.

This is an honest amp that rewards good playing and doesn't try to hide behind excessive features. While it lacks reverb and multiple channels, the OR15 excels at what it does – delivering authentic Orange tube tone with character and clarity at every gain setting. It's roughly the size of a shoebox but sounds like a much larger amp, making it ideal for anyone who needs genuine valve tone without the bulk.
