The Dyna Comp by MXR is an absolute classic among compressor pedals.

It's definitely not a "transparent" compressor or subtlety is not its strength.

You get a Dyna Comp for the extra squishiness and that chunky feel and character.

I usually don't use compressors for just "evening out" my sloppy playing. That makes it a clutch and does not help you become a better and more controlled guitarist.

Instead, I like to use it as a character effect. I love when the **SENSITIVITY** is cranked, with the volume slightly boosted so my amp constantly lives on that edge of breakup border.
