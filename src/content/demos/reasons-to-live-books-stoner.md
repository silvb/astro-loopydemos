Stoner is a unique fuzz pedal by Reasons To Live Books (yes, that's a book store).

The circuit is designed and built by Freqscene Effects, Co.

The name and the artwork are inspired by the book "Stoner" by John Williams. I actually read it after getting the pedal and now I really get the knob labels **SUFFERING** and **LONGING**. The novel is a weird mix of a super depressing story of the main character (Stoner) and a kind of cozy, stoic prose that makes you feel like you're reading a book by a fireplace in a cabin.

**SUFFERING** changes the texture of the fuzz. It goes from smooth-ish Big Muff-like wall of fuzz all the way to a gated, splatty fuzz that sounds like a dying circuit. **LONGING** adjusts the output volume.

The circuit is completely original. Stoner is honestly a lot of fun to play. It's like wielding a burning sword. You can never stop playing or you'll burn yourself!
