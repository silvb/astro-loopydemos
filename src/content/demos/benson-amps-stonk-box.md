The Stonk Box by Benson Amps is based on a vintage fuzz circuit from the 60s. Benson paired their Automatic Thermal Bias technology with one of the first iterations of the first fuzz circuit ever made.

The Stonk Box can be described as raunchy, aggressive, dynamic and full of character. The **FILTER** and **TRIM** controls are very interactive and can be used to dial in a wide range of tones. You can set it so that it behaves like a fuzz with the guitar volume turned down. It can be bright or wooly or anything in between.

I especially noticed that it sounds awesome with the neck pickup, wich is what you're hearing in this demo. The way the Stonk Box cuts through the mix even with a neck pickup is remarkable to me.
