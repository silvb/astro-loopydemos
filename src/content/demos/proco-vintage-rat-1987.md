I got this classic vintage ProCo RAT from 1987 on loan from my pal Kit (from [Twilight Pulse Audioworks](/demos/twilight-pulse-audioworks-konstante) and [OKKO FX](/demos/okko-fx-twin-sonic-mkii)). It seems to be a special unit with some kind of secret sauce because it sounds nothing like anything I've tried before.

There is just a bit more bite and chewiness to the sound and a compressed feel that's super pleasing when you play it.

If you can find one of these for a good deal, I highly recommend it.
