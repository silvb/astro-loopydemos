The Dagger by Electronic Audio Experiments is a wonderful op-amp drive that is super versatile, ranging from chimey, articulate low gain, to crunch, RAT-like distortion all the way to fuzz that I could easily confuse with a Big Muff.

The Dagger has its roots in the circuit of the EAE Longsword. To me this feels like a more than a trimmed-down version of its big sister.

Because the controls are so interactive and the EQ controls are active boost/cut controls, there is a ton of sounds in this pedal. In a studio situation, I could just throw this pedal in the chain and get most of my gain sounds just from this.

Being such a versatile sound machine, it's also incredible on bass (I might have a bass demo in the works...).

I highly. highly recommend this pedal to anyone who likes op-amp overdrive. Or just anyone who likes any kind of rock guitar sound really.
