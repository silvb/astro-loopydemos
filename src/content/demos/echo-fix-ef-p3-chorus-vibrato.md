The EF-P3 Chorus Vibrato by Echo Fix is the luxury version of vintage chorus and vibrato pedals in modern format.

It has a no-frills, utilitarian vibe but offers great variety with unique controls to fine tune how your sound gets warbled.

**WAVESHAPE** can be smoothly adjusted from a lush, subtle sine wave to a dramatic and spongy sounding triangle wave.

**RESONANCE** controls how much of the vibrato signal is being feedbacked into the BBD chip. Maxing this out makes the vibrato side feel almost like a chorus, even without the dry signal engaged.

Plus, you get a handy foot-switch to easily go between lo-fi vibrato sounds and lush chorus.
