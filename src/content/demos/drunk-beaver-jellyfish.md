The JellyFish nails that lush, swirling Small Clone chorus sound in a modern, feature-packed package. Drunk Beaver took the classic MN3007 bucket brigade circuit and made it more versatile with some clever additions. The Range switch gives you three distinct flavors: Clone mode for that familiar Kurt Cobain wobble, Leslie for gentler modulation that mimics a rotating speaker at higher speeds, and Blur for dramatic detuned textures.

What sets the JellyFish apart is the thoughtful engineering. The MN3007 runs internally at 15V from a standard 9V supply, which keeps noise floor impressively low. The Color knob shapes the wet signal's tone, letting you dial in anything from sparkly brightness to warm, mellow swirls. The Mix control goes from subtle seasoning to full vibrato when cranked, and that blue LED pulses with the rate so you can sync up visually.

I especially appreciate the Range switch's versatility. Clone mode is perfect for grunge and alternative tones, while Leslie mode gives you that gentle shimmer that works beautifully with cleaner settings. Blur mode gets wild - it's almost like having a dedicated vibrato or even mild pitch-shifting effect. The controls are sensitive enough to find sweet spots easily, and the LED brightness trimmers on the PCB are a nice touch for stage visibility.

This is Drunk Beaver's take on making the Small Clone more useful for modern players. It's got that vintage analog warmth but with the control range to work across genres. If you've been wanting classic chorus character with more tonal flexibility, the JellyFish delivers exactly that in a sturdy, well-thought-out pedal.
