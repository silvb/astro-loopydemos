The Tribute Parametric Overdrive by Catalinbread is the tool to precisely shape your tone to fit in a mix.

It offers a powerful one-band parametric EQ that you can use to boost/cut exactly the frequency you desire. The circuit design is inspired by a very early Catalinbread pedal â€“ the VariOBoost. Here is just a selection of a few use cases:

- Use it as a bass overdrive and add some low-end to the signal.
- For guitar, bump the mids to stand out in a mix.
- Or you can shave off some lower frequencies to gain clarity from an otherwise muddy neck pickup.
- Cut mids on the guitar to create space for vocals
- Add some upper mids or presence to add sparkle and note definition to your chords

The drive on the Tribute sounds and feels phenomenal. It seems very amp-like. And I know this is an annoying buzzword, so let me explain:
Most overdrives add some tone-shaping on top of the compression and saturation. They usually cut off bass frequencies or bump certain mid frequencies â€“ imprinting their own characteristic on the guitar tone.
The Tribute feels like an amp is breaking up, without it trying to emulate a specific amp. It's just your amp with a bit more grit.

The gain range goes to medium breakup. You can squeeze out a bit more saturation when you put a boost in front of it. For higher gain, I really like to stack with another medium gain drive in front of it.

In the demo above, you see it stacked after the [Vaderin HP-X](/demos/vaderin-pedals-hp-x). The HP-X sounds great on its own, but for higher gain rhythm playing, it's neat to be able to shave off some of the high end and add even more gain texture.

I also used it to slam the frontend of the [Smallsound/Bigsound Mini](/demos/smallsound-bigsound-mini). When you turn the pedals on and off, you can hear that the Mini is on a very tame setting, and the Tribute alone sounds a bit muffled with the boosted low mids. Together, they create an awesome almost fuzzy, grunting rhythm sound.

I also really like that there is some haptic feedback on the tone knob. In the noon position (i.e. 0db cut/boost, neutral tone), the knob "clicks" into position. Now, that's a nice touch!

I also have to note the very low noise level when I was recording for the demo loop. This feels really like a well-engineered, thought-through recording tool.

Plugging into the Tribute immediately inspired me to start riffing. It's definitely a better-maker for guitar and bass.

### Recording Notes

I tried adding a bunch more guitar overdubs, but ultimately found that this minimalistic track with only guitar, bass and drums does it for me ðŸ™‚

**Main Guitars**

- Epiphone SG Special with Lollar Firebird pickups (neck pickup)
- Double tracked and panned 25% left and right
- Tribute
- [Strymon Iridium (Chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

I used the same guitar and settings for the left and right channel and panned them just 25% to get a more focused, punchy sound (in contrast to a "wide" sound where I would hard pan two slightly different sounds).

**Bass**

- [JMJ Mustang\*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/R5A6bg), Fender flatwound strings, tone 100% up, played with a pick.
- Tribute with a 12dB boost at ~80-90Hz and drive slightly past noon
- Iridium on the round setting with SVT cabs, as demoed [here](/posts/strymon-iridium-bass-ownhammer-ir)

I really liked the tribute as a bass overdrive. There was very little EQing I had to do in the DAW.

**Drums**

- GarageBand drummer Zak (garage rock) on the Brooklyn kit
- Juiced up with the [FreeAMP](https://klevgrand.com/products/freeamp) plugin from Klevgrand

As usual, everything went into the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 and was mixed in GarageBand with a mild combination of compression, limiter and exciter on the master track to bring everything to life.
