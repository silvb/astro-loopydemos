The Orange Bass Butler is genuinely one of the most complete bass solutions I've ever used in pedal form. This bi-amp preamp gives you two completely separate signal chains – a clean channel and a high-gain guitar channel – running in parallel just like a real bi-amp rig. The 18V power supply delivers serious headroom, keeping both channels tight and punchy even when you're really digging in.

What makes the Bass Butler special is how well thought-out each channel is. The bass side keeps it simple with compression, bass, treble, and volume controls, plus a Class A VCA compressor that adds that signature Orange character. The guitar channel is where things get wild – four gain stages with five controls that can take you from musical overdrive to absolutely crushing modern tones. Both channels have their own XLR outputs with dedicated cabinet simulation, so you're ready to record or go direct to the PA right out of the box.

The practical features are what really seal the deal. You get an expression pedal input for controlling the input gain, a ground lift switch for solving earth loops, and a blended amp output that combines both channels before the cab sim. The cabinet simulations are spot-on too – an Orange OBC410 for the bass side and a PPC412 for the guitar side. It's genuinely ready for recording straight away, no additional processing needed.

I love how the Bass Butler doesn't just give you a bass preamp with some dirt – it's a complete bi-amp system that lets you blend fundamental bass tones with aggressive guitar-style overdrive. It's massive (takes up about three Boss pedal spaces) and needs that unique 18V power supply, but for bass players who want the ultimate fly rig or studio tool, this thing delivers everything you could need in one box.
