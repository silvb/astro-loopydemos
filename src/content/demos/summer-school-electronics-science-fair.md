The Science Fair by Summer School Electronics brings two of the most popular overdrive and distortion circuits into one box and it makes for a really versatile dirt box.

Ever stood in front of your pedalboard like a donkey between a water bucket and a hay bale? The Science Fair is the answer to your prayers. It combines two of the most popular overdrive and distortion circuits into one box: The ProCo RAT and the Ibanez TubeScreamer.

With the BLEND and VOLUME controls in the middle, you get to mix the two circuits together to create a wide range of tones. The clarity and smooth compression of the TubeScreamer can be sprinkled on top of the hairy, compressed crunch of the RAT. Genius!
