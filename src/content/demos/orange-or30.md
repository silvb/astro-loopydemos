The OR30 by Orange is one of those amps that makes you question everything you thought you knew about wattage ratings. Despite being a 30-watt head, this thing hits sound pressure levels that rival 100-watt amps, earning it the reputation as possibly the loudest 30-watt amp on the planet. Orange achieved this through cathode bias and tube rectification, giving you that classic Orange growl with serious authority.

What sets the OR30 apart is its deceptively simple control layout that packs serious versatility. You get a single channel with gain, a 3-band EQ, presence, and two master volume settings you can footswitch between for rhythm-to-lead boosts. The standout feature is Orange's first-ever bright switch, plus a cross-line presence control that actually works at bedroom volumes unlike traditional negative feedback designs. There's also a headroom switch that drops the output from 30 watts down to 2 watts for apartment-friendly practice.

The OR30's massive gain sweep means you're essentially getting two-channel versatility from a single-channel design. Roll your guitar volume back to 5 and you'll get surprisingly clean Orange tones with that signature tube rectifier sag. Crank everything up and you're in chunky high-gain territory that's beloved by the stoner-doom crowd. The cathode bias design means you can swap power tubes without rebias, and the tube-buffered effects loop keeps your time-based effects pristine.

If you need that classic Orange sound with serious volume and surprising versatility in a single channel, the OR30 delivers. Just make sure your neighbors are prepared for what's about to hit them.
