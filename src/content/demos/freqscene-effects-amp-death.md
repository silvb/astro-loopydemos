The Amp Death by Freqscene Effects is a gated fuzz and overdrive. It unapologetically adds texture and gritty-ness to your signal – absent of any subtlety.

It was designed to make your amp sound like it's about to die. The giant **TEXTURE** knob adjusts how gated or smooth the drive sounds.

**FREQ** let's you dial in the post-gain high-pass filter. Turn it clockwise to cut bass.

Amp Death has a fixed gain level, so there is no messing with edge-of-breakup or anything subtle. This is meant ot be used as a broad-stroke color. You'll definitely notice when it's on.

Gated fuzz/drive is probably my favorite effect and I'll never get tired of playing with this texture.
