The Twin Peaks Eiger-Mönch by RhPf Electronics is a dual delay pedal with a clever twist.

You can either run both delay lines in parallel (toggle to the left) or activate the cascade mode (toggle to the right) and have them feedbacking into each other.

Although this is a mono pedal, I can't shake off the stereo feeling I get from it. There is something haunting in the way both delay circuits are voiced. One is bright and clear, the other is warm, soft and analog-like.

The Twin Peaks Eiger-Mönch was not made to be precise for dotted 8th notes for a U2 cover band. It's meant to create lush and texturized soundscapes.
