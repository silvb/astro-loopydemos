The Ray Gun is a phaser with the extras typical for modulation pedals from Poison Noises.

It's highly adjustable and has many phaser types built in (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 stage phasers and phaser combined with flanger, octave and aliaser).

This makes for a wild ride and let's you create really unique sounds. From all the crazy modulation boxes from Poison Noises, this was the most fun to experiment with for me so far.

### Recording Notes

**Guitar**

- K'mo Memphis Std., classic T-style pickups (neck pickup)
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) (compression maxed out)
- Ray Gun
- [Strymon Iridium (chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

**Bass**

- JMJ Fender Mustang, Fender flats, plucked with fingers, tone ~50%
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) to even it out
- [Bondi Effects Sick As Overdrive](/demos/bondi-effects-sick-as-mkiii)
- Strymon Iridium (round) [with bass cabs](/posts/strymon-iridium-bass-ownhammer-ir/)

**Overdubs**

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa with different pickup configs
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) (compression maxed out)
- Ray Gun
- [Bondi Effects Sick As Overdrive](/demos/bondi-effects-sick-as-mkiii)
- [Boss DM-2w Delay](/demos/boss-dm-2w-delay) used in stereo

I also used the [Walrus Audio Sl√∂](/demos/walrus-audio-slo) in latch mode, ran it through the Sick As, Ray Gun and [OBNE Screen Violence](/demos/old-blood-noise-endeavors-screen-violence) and just hit record to get a subtle, ambient stereo drone in the background.

**Drums**

- GarageBand Drummer Darcy (pop songwriter) on the Bluebird kit
- Kick and snare treated with the stock GarageBand RAT-style pedal plugin

The whole mix was "mastered" with exciter, limiter and mild compression in the DAW.
