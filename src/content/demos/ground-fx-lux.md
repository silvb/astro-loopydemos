The Lux by Ground FX is a digital plate-style reverb. It is simple, elegant and beautiful sounding.

PLate is probably my favorite type of reverb and the Lux nails that pristine and lush sound. It's a great pedal for ambient and shoegaze, but it can also be used for more subtle and traditional reverb sounds.

The Lux has a second set of MIX/DECAY controls which gives you two presets that you can switch between. On top, you get a global PRE-DELAY control for added clarity and a global VOLUME control. The sheer volume output of the Lux is not only sufficient to match your dry bypassed signal. There's a lot of volume on tap that can easily push your amp or a dirt pedal after it.

I love how Ground FX strikes the balance between super simple, utilitarian design and really useful features.
