The Pardner Fuzz by Old Blood Noise Endeavors is a beautiful fuzz unit that goes beyond the standard ways of smashing your sound.

You can switch its voicing between **SYNTHY** and **FUZZY**. It offers a 2-band EQ and a powerful **FILTER** section on top.

The fun really starts when you engage the **LASSO** circuit. This allows you to use an FX loop to insert your favorite additional effect to the signal chain. This makes the Pardner the perfect platform to create experimental and weird sounds.

When there is no additional effects connected via the FX loop, **LASSO** will just act as a boost/overdrive. It sounds to me as if this is some kind of dirty treble booster.

Pardner lets you switch the order of effects. You can run the **FUZZ** and **LASSO** circuits in parallel and mix with their gain/volume knobs, or run one after the other to create shoegaze-y and destroyed soundscapes.

Each single component of the Pardner would be worth putting into its own pedal. Combined, there are a lot of textures to explore to put out some heavy psych-rock sounds.
