JPTR FX dub their Katastrophe "The Sludgefest Dominator". And, boy does it deliver on that title.

The Katastrophe is a high-gain distortion pedal that's designed to deliver the kind of thick, saturated tones that are perfect for sludge, doom, and stoner rock.

It features an EQ section typical for Plexi-style Marhshall™ amps as well as a LOW CUT control to tame the low-end rumble. You can activate an independent analog octave-up circuit with the left footswitch – perfect for leads or sludgey riffs.

The output volume of the Katastrophe is enormous, so you can easily use this to drive your amp or other drive pedals after it into thick distortion.
