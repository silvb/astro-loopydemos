The Remnant by Poison Noises is wonderful take on the classic tape delay sound.

Whenever I can, I like to have some modulation going in my time-based effects. The Remnant delivers tasteful modulation on its delay repeats.

Playing with the RAVAGE (feedback) is also lots of fun. I like when a delay gives you this fine line between clean and sweet repeats and chaotic, out of control feedback. Finding just the right amount of feedback to not let the self-oscillation take over completely creates interesting pad sounds.
