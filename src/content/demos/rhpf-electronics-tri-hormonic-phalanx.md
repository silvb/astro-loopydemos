The Tri-Hormonic Phalanx by RHPF Electronics takes a methodical approach to tone shaping with independent control over three frequency bands - lows, mids, and highs. Each band has its own MOSFET-driven gain stage and level control, designed to sit first in your signal chain where it sculpts your fundamental tone before hitting other effects.

What I appreciate about the Phalanx is how it enhances rather than overwhelms. You can dial in exactly the tonal balance you want - more clarity in the highs, warmth in the lows, or midrange punch that cuts through a mix. The MOSFET design keeps things musical and responsive, whether you're going for subtle enhancement or pushing harder for harmonic excitement.

The Swiss build quality is solid and road-ready, with intuitive controls once you get the hang of the tri-band approach. There's enough output volume to drive whatever comes next, and it's particularly effective as a foundation for stacking with overdrives and distortions.

This isn't a pedal that screams for attention - it's more like having a good preamp built into your guitar. If you want a boost that shapes your tone rather than just making it louder, the Tri-Hormonic Phalanx offers control that's hard to find elsewhere.
