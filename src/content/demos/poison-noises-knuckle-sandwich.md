The Knuckle Sandwich by Poison Noises is a T-style overdrive that is packing some extra punches.

Not only is this great at making tubes scream, this is just a versatile overdrive that's not limited by its origins.

There are so many sound possibilties just with the different clipping mode and diode combinations.

The universal rule for this style of pedal is to keep the gain low and the volume high to use it as a dirty mid-boost. While you can definitely do that with the Knuckle Sandwich, you're missing out if you don't explore its high gain options.

Plus, the **Clobber** knob that controls the bass response makes this a viable option for guitar and bass.
