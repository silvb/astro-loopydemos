I enjoy the King Comp because it just gets compression right without getting in the way. Orange took their VCA circuit approach from their studio compressors and built it into a pedal that enhances rather than squashes. The 18V power supply gives you all the headroom you need for hot pickups or complex pedalboard setups, and that super low noise floor means you can leave this thing on all the time.

The four-knob layout keeps things simple but incredibly effective. The attack and release controls let you dial in everything from subtle tightening to that bouncy, percussive feel that makes every note pop. I love how the attack knob can take you from transparent sustain all the way to that pronounced "pogo" effect when you really crank it. The compression knob has a nice wide range too – it's easy to find that sweet spot where notes sing without feeling artificial.

What sets this apart from typical compressor pedals is how musical it sounds. Where many comps can make your guitar feel disconnected from your playing, the King Comp stays responsive to your touch. The buffered bypass keeps your signal strong, and that dual-color LED (blue when on, pink when compressing) gives you perfect visual feedback for dialing in your settings. It works brilliantly on bass too, tightening up the low end without robbing power.

The King Comp excels as an always-on tone sweetener that adds sustain and snap while keeping your natural dynamics intact. Whether you're looking for studio-quality compression for recording or a reliable live pedal that enhances everything you play, this delivers that warm, professional sound Orange is known for in a compact, pedalboard-friendly package.
