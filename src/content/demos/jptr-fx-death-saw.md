The Death Saw by JPTR FX is simple and unapologetic abouts it's raw, high gain sound.

Diming all the controls of a Boss HM-2 to create that chainsaw metal sound has almost become a meme. JPTR FX took it to heart and created the Death Saw, which is a refined version of that sound without a chance to fiddle with anything.

You stomp on it, and everyone around you will know that this pedal is on.

I'm not much of a metal player, but I do find the Death Saw to be suitable for shoegaze and heavy emo midwest riffs.

It offers quite a different flavor to other distortion pedals, and combined with an eery reverb like the [Sinkhole](/demos/catalinbread-sinkhole), you get some interesting noise-scapes.

The Death Saw is very present in the midrange and seems to have an EQ peak at around 1.3 kHz. That makes it a great candidate for double tracking on a heavy guitar part to make it sound bigger and give everything more bite.

For bedroom players like myself, an EQ pedal like the [MAE Line Blur](/demos/mask-audio-electronics-line-blur) comes in hand to tame the aggressive midrange for a more balanced and chuggy sound.
