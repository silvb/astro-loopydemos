The Crushturnal by Collision Devices is an epic ambient texture and soundscape machine.

It consists of 3 sonical unit that all center around the big **CLOCK** control in the middle.

You get the **AMBIENCE** unit, a shimmer reverb that goes from ethereal spaciousness to dark and murky lo-fi verb.

The **DIGITAL REPEATER** is delay that can be crushed beyond recogniction when reducing the **SAMPLE RATE**.

The thing that probably many people need to wrap their head around for a few seconds is the **SEQUENCER**. This unit affects both the delay and reverb part of the Crushturnal.

Think of the **SEQUENCER** as a step-wise automation of the **CLOCK** knob. The **STEP SIZE** is defined in musical pitch distances. **MODE** offers different options on how the clock steps are sequenced.

I really like how the Crushturnal is immensely deep and invites you to explore glitchy, ambient textures for hours. At the same time, it's very intuitive and let's you dial in great sounds for an instantly gratifying play experience.
