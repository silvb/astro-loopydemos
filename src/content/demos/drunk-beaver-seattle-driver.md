The Seattle Driver nails that gritty, aggressive 90s grunge tone in a compact pedal that's both familiar and refreshingly modern. Vitalii Bobrov from Drunk Beaver took the notoriously misunderstood Boss PW-2 Power Driver and gave it the refinement it always deserved—adding surgical 3-band EQ (80Hz, 875Hz, 1550Hz), a blendable analog octave-up, and much cleaner power handling.

What I love about this thing is how the six controls work together to shape your sound. Fat controls the bass, Muscle handles the mids, and Air manages the top-end sparkle—giving you surgical control over the 3-band EQ. Power drives the gain stage for everything from clean boost to saturated grunge, while Exhaust acts as your overall output volume. The Vacuum control is where things get interesting—it blends in that analog octave-up for added fuzz and compression.

The analog octave blend is subtle but effective, adding a fuzzy, compressed character. Unlike digital octave effects, this one feels musical and organic, especially when you're digging into single notes or power chords. The 3-band active EQ gives you serious tonal flexibility—you can shape this pedal to work with virtually any amp or playing style.

At 30mA current draw on standard 9V power, the Seattle Driver is well-behaved on any pedalboard. It's got that lifetime warranty confidence behind it, and frankly, it also looks way cooler than the standard PW-2 it's based on. Whether you're chasing Kurt Cobain's Nevermind tones or just want a versatile distortion that can do both vintage and modern sounds, this one delivers.
