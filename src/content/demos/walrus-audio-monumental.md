The Monumental by Walrus Audio is a Harmonic Stereo Tremolo pedal with exactly right amount of features paired with a straighforward interface.

With the Monumental, you get

- tap tempo with switchable subdivisions
- presets
- different waveforms (and a random mode!)
- stereo/mono operation
- a smooth blend between harmonic and standard tremolo
- a control to narrow/widen the stereo image

If you dial it in correctly (which is not hard at all), you can get some rich and lush stereo modulation sounds that are perfect for ambient music, but also for more traditional tremolo sounds.

And of course the artwork and enclosure finish are gorgeous as always with Walrus Audio.
