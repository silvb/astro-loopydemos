I instantly ordered a Radio Dirtman from Vaderin Pedals after I read the description of what it does.

It's based on the Dirt Transmitter with a wider frequency range on the tone control, with much more low end possible.

The Radio Dirtman is can deliver all kinds of dirt flavor: gated or wooly fuzz, smooth overdrive, or crackly lo-fi distortion or that satisfying saturation you get from plugging in straight to the desk and cranking the gain.

I'm a huge QOTSA fan and I know that Michael Shuman uses a Dirt Transmitter live on a few tracks where the bass sound really stands out. Here's where I first heard of it:

The Radio Dirtman Nails this and I love it both on guitar and bass.
