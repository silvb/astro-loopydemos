The Fuzz Factory by ZVEX Effects is an absolute classic fuzz pedal.

It's a pedal that's known for its wild and unpredictable nature. ZVEX was one of the first brands to explore the "boutique" pedal market, with handwired circuits and hand-painted enclosures.

I first stumbled over the Fuzz Factory when I was trying to figure out how to get the sound of the guitar solo in "Plug In Baby" by Muse.

While preparing this demo, I discovered that the Fuzz Factory has a lot more sounds to offer than just a typical fuzz for big rock riffs and lead lines.

All the quirky controls are super interactive and can take you from a classic fuzz sound to a velcro-like gated fuzz, to a weird and sputtery fuzz that's almost synth-like.

The Fuzz Factory can be unwieldy at times so you need to play to it. But that's what makes it so much fun to use as a creative tool.
