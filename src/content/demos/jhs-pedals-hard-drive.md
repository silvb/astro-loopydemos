The JHS Hard Drive is a unique distortion pedal and extremely versatile.

JHS advertises this to easily mimick several legendary distortion boxes (Marshall Shredmaster, [RAT](/demos/proco-vintage-rat-1987), [DS-1](/demos/boss-ds-1-distortion), etc.).

I'm not super interested in a do-it-all distortion pedal. I just tried this out of curiosity without any expectations. Boy, I did not plan to like this as much as I do now after playing it.

The Hard Drive also makes it possible to find a really unique sound and feel in that 90s grunge vibe. And that's my happy place :)

It has that sweet spot with a super satisfying crunch with the gain past noon.

The powerful EQ options come in handy for most every musical occation. I'd say if you have a recording studio, this should be in your drawer.
