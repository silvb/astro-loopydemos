The Little Bass Thing by Orange packs 500W of Class D power into a 3kg package that's perfect for bass players who need serious clean headroom in a portable format. This solid-state bass head combines the power section from Orange's Terror Bass series with a streamlined preamp that gets straight to business.

I enjoy how simple this thing is to dial in. The 3-band EQ features a sweepable parametric mid control with 15dB of cut and boost across all frequencies, which is exactly what you need to find your spot in the mix. The built-in optical compressor is footswitchable and uses the same Class A VCA technology as Orange's Kongpressor pedal, adding just the right amount of punch and control.

What surprised me about the Little Bass Thing is how clean and neutral it actually is. Unlike many Orange amps, there's no built-in gain or saturation here - just pure, clean volume with excellent headroom. This makes it a fantastic platform for dirt and distortion pedals, letting them shine without adding unwanted coloration. The PAD switch handles hot active pickups perfectly, and the balanced DI output makes recording a breeze.

At this power level and weight, the Little Bass Thing nails the sweet spot between portability and stage volume. It's essentially a high-powered clean canvas that happens to have Orange DNA in the form build quality and that flexible EQ section. If you're looking for a neutral, powerful bass head that'll make your pedals sound exactly like they should, this little white box delivers exactly that.
