Ezhi & Aka's Brom is glitchy, noisy and weird fuzz in the best possible way.

The lack of labels encourages experimenting with it and to just set it to a weird sound that makes you feel funny. After some experimentation, I think deciphered this little box of wonder:

- The bottom 3 knobs are just volume knobs for the 3 independent fuzz circuits inside the brom.
- **AMP FUZZ**: Volume controlled by the first knob from the bottom. It's an overdriven and starved IC amplifier. High gain, open, dying decay but quite a bit of sustain with little noise. This is the most "normal" sound from the Brom and I like to use it to mix with the other weirder modes. That way, your riffs stay in musical and the weirder circuits can be used to blend in crazy textures.
- **TAPE FUZZ**: Volume controlled by the second knob from the bottom. This adds proper weirdness. The bottom toggle let's you choose 3 modes for this circuit. **Up** gives you random glitches, **middle** seems to add just a tiny delay. Mixed with **AMP FUZZ**, tih makes for a sweet doubling effect. **Down** transforms it into a fuzzy auto swell.
- **NOISE FUZZ**: Volume controlled by the third knob from below. This is a ring-mod kinda thing. The upper toggle makes this into either a tremolo, upper or lower ring-mod/harmonics. The first knob from the top controls the modulation rate.

All in all, the Brom is the fuzz I reach for if I want something different. It's quirky, aggressive and yet musical. You don't need to study this pedal to get good sounds.

It's the one pedal everyone will ask you about after a gig: _"What was that sound?"_
