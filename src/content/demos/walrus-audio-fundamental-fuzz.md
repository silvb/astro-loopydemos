The Fundamental Fuzz by Walrus Audio simple and aggressive fuzz that is super user friendly and easy to dial in.

After plugging into the Fundamental Fuzz, it's pretty obvious that it's some kind of Big Muff variant. Just from the sound and feel, I have a hunch that it could be op-amp based รก la Smashing Pumpkins, but I could be wrong.

I like the choice of modes here. A gated fuzz is always welcome in my house, the classic bread and butter muff sound and a mode with added mids in the tone stack.

Especially in context of a backing track, you can hear how much of a difference this mid bump makes. The GATED and CLASSIC mode kinda mold into the backing track, while the MID+ jumps forward (all tracks are normalized for the same peak loudness).

Like with the whole Fundamental Series, I really dig the choices of controls. The faders "snap" in the middle, which makes you think that this is the intended sweet spot from the builder.

### Signal Chain

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (bridge pickup)
- Fundamental Fuzz
- Walrus Audio Fundamental Reverb with a very short spring reverb setting just to add a touch of space to make the fuzz "breath"
- [Strymon Iridium (chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

I also used the Fuzz in classic mode on bass together with some EQ from the [MAE Line Blur](/demos/mask-audio-electronics-line-blur) and it sounds massive and punchy.

I also used the Delay, Phaser, Fuzz and Reverb from the Fundamental Series to record guitar overdubs and lead lines for the backing track.
