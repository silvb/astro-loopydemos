The Eons Five-State Fuzz by Walrus Audio is a highly versatile dirt box to basically replace every fuzz you've ever tried.

Like its brothers ([Eras](/demos/walrus-audio-eras) and Ages), it offers five different flavors.

And of course it has my favorite kind of knob on a fuzz: a voltage/bias control. With all these flavors, active cut/boost bass and treble controls, the Eons offers every kind of fuzz you could think of.
