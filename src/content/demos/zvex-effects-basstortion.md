The Basstortion by ZVEX Effects delivers exactly what it says on the packaging: great bass distortion.

The controls are as simple as it gets for overdrive/distortion pedals: **DRIVE**, **TONE** and **VOLUME**. Additionally, there is a toggle to switch between **BRIGHT** and **DARK** mode.

Whilst being a simple distortion box, the Basstorion has a versatile range from bright clang for aggressive punk rock, smooth saturation for subtle presence and can be driven to fuzz-like distortion while retaining ample amounts of low end.
