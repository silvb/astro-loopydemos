The Orange Fur Coat nails that classic '70s octave fuzz sound in a modern, roadworthy package. Based on the legendary Foxx Tone Machine, it gives you four knobs – Volume, EQ, Octave, and Fuzz – plus dual footswitches for instant octave engagement without bending over mid-solo.

What makes this special is the adjustable octave blend. Instead of just switching octaves on/off, you can dial in how much octave sits on top of the fuzz. The effect is strongest around the 12th fret with your neck pickup, creating that unmistakable piercing octave scream that cuts through any mix. The fuzz itself is warm and thick, with the EQ control taming the natural brightness without losing punch.

The dual footswitch setup is brilliant – fuzz on the right, octave on the left. You can run straight fuzz, then kick in the octave for leads, or stack them both for maximum chaos. It runs on 9V-12V, with higher voltage opening up more headroom and grunt. True bypass keeps your signal clean when off.

For a $155 pedal, the Fur Coat delivers vintage octave fuzz tones that would cost way more in original form. It's perfect for classic rock, psych, or anywhere you need that distinctive '70s fuzz character.
