The Pork & Pickle by Way Huge is a bass overdrive and fuzz pedal with a clean blend.

The voicing and knob ranges of this surprisingly small box are extremely well tuned. I got an instantly gratifying tone when I plugged my bass into it.

Both the OD and the Fuzz side can give you a very robust, full-bodied bass tone with lovely saturation and sizzle without loosing low end.

### Signal Chain

- [JMJ Fender Mustang\*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/R5A6bg), [La Bella Flats\*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/WqZN6Z) and Curtis Novak Fat Mustang pickups, played with [0.73mm Dunlop Tortex pick\*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/gOO5r2)
- Pork & Pickle
- [Bogren Digital Bassknob STD](https://bogrendigital.com/collections/ampknob/products/bassknob-std) set to clean
- [UAD Pultec EQP-1A\*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/GmxWGn) to shape some mids (makes the bass stand out a little more against the drums and it's easier to hear differences between the pedals)
- Some more EQ with the stock Logic Pro X Channel EQ to make the bass sit well in the mix
