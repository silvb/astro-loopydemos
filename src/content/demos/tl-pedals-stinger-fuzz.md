The Stinger Fuzz by TL Pedals is a high quality boutique version of the beloved Big Muff circuit.

It's based on a '73 Violet Ram's Head Big Muff. I instantly think of Dinosaur Jr when I hear this. When I first plugged in the Stinger Fuzz, I didn't do any research beforehand and just started riffing. This inconspicuous looking box instantly conjured a stank face on me.

There is just some brutality to the sound, yet it always feels tight and under control. Plus, there is a mids control to adjust your sound in a band mix.

This is a great take on a classic circuit with very useful additions. The build quality is top-notch, everything about the Stinger Fuzz feels solid and rugged. I highly recommend this to anyone GASing for great sounding Big Muffs.
