The Unpleasant Surprise by Fairfield Circuitry is actually a pleasant little surprise if you enjoy fuzz and octave fuzz full of texture and character.

The control interface has an elegant simplicity to it. With just a **VOLUME** and gain/gate threshold (**ONSET**) knob and three 2-way toggles **T** (treble), **G** (gain) and **C** (crush) that define the characteristic of the fuzz.

**C** unlocks the octave fuzz tones hidden in The Unpleasant Surprise.

**G** toggles between a more "open" and a more compressed sound.

**T** provides the option for a simple output treble cut.

Some pedals are good for scientifically dialing in your exact tone. The Unpleasant Surprise is more about happy accidents and finding the sweet spots by ear. On top of that, it's just extremely fun to play and it's very hard to find an uninspiring sound with it.
