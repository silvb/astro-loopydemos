MXR did a great service to us pedal nerds by bringing Paul Cochrane's Timmy circuit to the masses.

It is a low to medium gain overdrive and it often get's mentioned when throwing out buzzwords like "transparent overdrive".

It has a powerful EQ section to really make it anything but transparent.

But the way the Timmy shapes your guitar tone feels very organic and musical at all ranges of the controls.

You can coax a lot of different sounds out of this tiny pedal. From cleanish boost, to fuzzy drive, edge of breakup or just a touch of sparkle to cut through a mix – the Timmy can get you there.

The **CLIP** toggle gives you 3 different clipping configurations – varying from mild saturation, heavier compression and a more open, high headroom feel.
