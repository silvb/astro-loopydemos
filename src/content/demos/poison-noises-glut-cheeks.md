The Glut Cheeks by Poison Noises is a modded Tone Bender Fuzz that delivers velcro goodness.

Rich, chewy and splattery velcro fuzz is what my heart desires. And the Glut Cheeks fulfills this desire completely.

As always, the knob labels tend to be rather cryptic. I've "translated" them in the demo widget above.

From what I can hear when playing the pedal, **Even More** (the EQ section) is a high-pass filter. Turning it counter clockwise removes bass frequencies.

**Devour** switches between 2 and 3 transistor configurations. It sounds to me like the "up" is 2 transistors (more open, less compressed, less gain) and "down" is 3 transistors.

**Stuff** is translated by Poison Noises as a "thickness" control. I believe this controls how much bass frequencies enter pedal. It subtly changes the bass response in interaction with the gain control.

**Choke** is the magic knob for me. It can turn the Glut Cheeks from an open, mid-gain overdrive to a ripping velcro fuzz, all at the same gain level.

If you don't wanna spent a fortune on vintage Tone Benders, and you want a feature-packed, versatile and reliable pedal, check out the Glut Cheeks.

**Overdubs ("verse" section)**

- Gretsch Electromatic, both pickups
- [Bondi Effects Sick As Overdrive](/demos/bondi-effects-sick-as-mkiii)
- [Walrus Audio Polychrome](/demos/walrus-audio-polychrome)

- The little lead line was the Gretsch on the bridge pickup, and Soft Focus into the Glut Cheeks

**Bass**
