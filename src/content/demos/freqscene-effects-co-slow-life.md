The Slow Life by Freqscene Effects Co. is a reimagination of the famous and discontinued Boss SG-1 Slow Gear.

At the most basic level, it's an auto-swell pedal that let's you play your guitar as if it where a violin ðŸ˜‰.

Freqscene always puts a clever twist into their pedals â€“ keeping them simple to use but with that one extra bit of spice.

The Slow Life includes an added compressor. When recording the demo track, I found this crucial to be comfortable with the delicate picking I had to do to bring out the "swell-y-ness".

I love that there is a **RANGE** knob to control the swell time. Short swell times are a common complaint among SG-1 users and this gives you longer swells if that's your desire.

### Signal Chain

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (both pickups)
- Slow Life
- [Mixwave Benson Chimera Plugin\*](https://sweetwater.sjv.io/B0N2PL)
- Quit a bit of reverb from the [Valhalla Vintage Verb plugin](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-vintage-verb/). I normally don't put that much extra color onto the guitar track when demoing pedals, but I'm convinced this is the context where an auto-swell works best.
