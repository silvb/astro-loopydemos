Into the Waves by Tone Charm Audio is a clever combination of distortion and delay, designed to serve any noise rock, shoegaze, or post-punk need you might have.

If we unpack this bit by bit, we get a modulated delay where the modulation is sensitive to the input signal. The harder you pick, the more pitch bend is happening on the delay repeats.

The distortion seems to be based on the [RAT](/demos/proco-vintage-rat-1987). With the DIRT toggle, you decide whether the distortion is applied on just the repeats or the dry signal as well. You can get shoegazy wall of sound effects or just subtle, compressed repeats with some lofi crunch.

The DIVE knob controls how fast the modulation ducks when you press the left foot switch (unfortunately, my demo format doesn't allow me to show this). The middle foot switch maxes out the feedback for more sponteneous noise effects.

My favorite setting is the first "Grimey Waves" setting. With the FILTER all the way open and a healthy amount of GAIN applied to both wet and dry signal, with subtle modulation, this is my happy place.

On some days I have to dig a little deeper to find a riff that I'm happy with for the demo loop. With Into the Waves, I just fiddled with the settings for a few minutes and was instantly inspired to play.
