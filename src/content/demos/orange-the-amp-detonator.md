The Orange Amp Detonator solves the ABY problem with style and substance. Unlike basic switchers that color your tone or create hum, this compact unit uses proper buffering and an isolation transformer to keep your signal pristine across two amps without the usual headaches.

What sets it apart is the dual buffered outputs – one clean, one transformer-isolated to eliminate ground loops. The phase switch on top corrects those awful out-of-phase cancellations that plague many ABY setups. Silent switching means no pops between amps, and that oversized tri-color LED shows exactly what's happening: green for A, red for B, blue for both.

The internal charge pump doubles your 9V supply to 18V internally, giving serious headroom and incredibly low distortion. You can run it off a battery (the only active ABY that does this), 9V, or 12V adapter. Individual footswitches let you hit A, B, or both amps simultaneously – perfect for blending clean and dirty tones or creating massive stereo spreads.

For an ABY switcher that actually works without compromise, the Amp Detonator delivers. It's built like a tank, sounds transparent, and handles the technical challenges that turn other switchers into tone-sucking noise makers.
