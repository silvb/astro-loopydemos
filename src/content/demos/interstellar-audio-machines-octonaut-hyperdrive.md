The Octonaut Hyperdrive by Interstellar Audio Machines is a cool drive pedal for that transparent but focused sound to push your amp into sweet, creamy gain.

This is a Klon-style overdrive, straight forward with just the 3 essential knobs and zero clutter on the user interface.

Plus, look at that ultra-cool design. If you want that classic Klon-tone with premium build quality and killer looks on your pedalboard, get the Octonaut Hyperdrive!
