The Classic 108 Fuzz by MXR shows that you need the tiniest setup to create a massive sounding guitar track.

The 108 is a faithful recreation of the 2-transistor Fuzz Face circuit. It offers an added buffer toggle to put it anywhere in your signal chain.

You get modern reliability, small foot print and vintage sound.
