The Orange Acoustic Pedal gets out of your way and lets your acoustic guitar sound like itself - only better. This single-ended Class A preamp runs at 18V instead of the usual 9V, giving the JFET circuit tons of headroom for an exceptionally clean, low-noise signal. You get a quality DI, parametric EQ with anti-feedback notch filter, and buffered effects loop all in one compact orange box.

The parametric midrange section really shines here. The notch filter sweeps from 68Hz to 1.2kHz and works with the Q Factor control to dial out problematic frequencies without sacrificing your guitar's natural character. The phase switch tackles pickup/mic phasing issues, while the balanced XLR output gives you professional connectivity for recording or live feeds.

What strikes me most is how quiet this thing is. The 18V operation pays off - I couldn't detect any additional hiss when engaged, crucial for acoustic applications where every sound gets magnified. The buffered effects loop lets you insert reverbs or delays without compromising signal integrity. The only quirk is no bypass footswitch, so it's always on - but with sound this good and noise this low, that's hardly a problem.

The Orange Acoustic Pedal hits the sweet spot between professional features and accessible pricing. Perfect for gigging players needing reliable DI capabilities, home recording enthusiasts, or anyone dealing with feedback issues. This isn't just another acoustic preamp - it's a thoughtfully designed tool that makes amplifying acoustics straightforward.
