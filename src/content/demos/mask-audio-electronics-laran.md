The Laran by Mask Audio Electronics and GÃ¸rva Design has its origins in the Big Muff circuit. However, the resulting sonic possibilities surpass the vanilla Big Muff.

Unlike standard [Big Muffs](/demos/ehx-big-muff-nyc), the Laran has a very usable gain range at lower settings. It almost reminds me of a [RAT](/demos/proco-vintage-rat-1987) distortion.

When you dime the **MORE** control, it gets suuuper compressed, gnarly and overpowering in a good way.

It sure wasn't meant to be used subtly. You will definitely know when it's on.
