The Silver Machine by JPTR FX is the octave fuzz pedal your ears deserve.

In typical JPTR FX fashion, the Silver Machine has ubiquitous amounts of volume and gain on tap.

The two **GAIN** filters are highly interactive. The Silver Machine is never subtle, but by experimenting with different **GAIN** settings, you can find vintage-y octave fuzz tones, sludgy doom tones, and everything in between.

Notice how the lead guitar does that typical smooth, yet unstable thing that octave fuzzes do. I used the bridge pickup with the tone completely rolled off to get that sound.
