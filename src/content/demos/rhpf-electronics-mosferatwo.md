The Mosferatwo by RhPf Electronics is a MOSFET based overdrive and distortion pedal.

The circuit design is original and not trying to emulate anything familiar. In the short time I had the Mosferatwo to play around with and come with riffs for a demo, I've grown very fond of it.

I think – maybe due to it being an original circuit – this pedal transform into whatever its owner wants it to be naturally.

The gain range and EQ options are very broad and versatile. For me, this became an instantly perfect match for stoner rock tones and heavier riffage.

I love cranking the **DRIVE** knob and **HEART** in the 320Hz mode to approximate those filthy, low-mid boosted tones I know from earlier Queens of the Stone Age records.

Mosferatwo adds a lot of character to your sound and worked especially well with my down-tuned guitar in this track (Drop D and then tuned down a whole note, so ... standard D + Drop C I guess?)
