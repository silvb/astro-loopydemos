The EarthQuaker Devices Blumes is a rock-solid bass overdrive with enough sonic options to fit it into any recording situation.

It's a modded version of it's guitar sister the [Plumes](/demos/earthquaker-devices-plumes), which itself is hot-rodded TubeScreamer.

There is plenty of saturation colors to choose from here. Blumes can add warmth, bite, girth, fatness and whatever else your bass rig might need to sound jucier.

I'm thankful that EQD did not opt for the obvious clean blend.

Instead, the Blumes is just well-voiced for bass from the get-go. It let's through enough low-end while still adding lots of character to the signal.
