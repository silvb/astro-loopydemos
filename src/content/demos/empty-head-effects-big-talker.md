The Big Talker by Empty Head Effects is dual tremolo pedal that looks daunting at first sight. But after a short onboarding period, it's a lot of fun and can get you very unique sounds.

There are a lot of controls with cryptic labels on it, so let's decipher these first:

- **Tremolo A**: **TOPIC A** is speed and the upper **INTENSITY** is depth. This tremolo can either be shaped like a square wave or random LFO, switchable via **CONFUSION**. When it's set to random (toggle down), you can't control the speed, so **TOPIC A** does nothing in this mode.
- **Tremolo B**: Speed and depth are **CROSSTALK** and the second **INTENSITY**, respectively. It seems to be more of a smooth sinus wave tremolo. **SUBJECT MATTER** toggles this between a normal tremolo to an envelope-controlled trem. The harder you play, the faster the LFO oscillates. Here **CROSSTALK** sets the maximum speed. When you play an note and let it ring out, you can hear the LFO getting slower as the note dies down. **CONCENTRATION** controls the sensitivity of the envelope-control.
- **TACT** is a volume control with quite a bit of boost on tap. Signal flow is boost/volume --> Tremolo A --> Tremolo B

To be honest, I'm not much of a tremolo user. However, the Big Talker offers something special here. If there has ever been a creative way to turn the volume up and down, this is it. I love how the combined tremolos create this diffused soundscape when dialed in just right.
