The Wilderness by NativeAudio is an analog voiced delay with a few digital tricks up its sleeve.

The voicing of this delay sounds wonderfully warm and textured. It can cover a lot of your sonic needs. Turn down the modulation rate and depth and have a clean, digital delay with an analog feel. Add modulation to get a subtle, tape-like feel or really wonky vibrato.

I really like the feedback at around 2 o'clock. It's not yet getting out of control. But there is a nice saturation and distortion going on in the repeats here that has a warm, lo-fi feel to it. In the _Endless Limbo_ setting, it's at the sweet spot right before self-oscillation, giving you almost endless repeats.

The Wilderness has a very nice and simple user interface. At first glance, all the knobs and switches might look daunting. But, after a minute of playing it, it becomes very intuitive.

For the loop in this demo, I mainly used it in **tap** mode, so the repeats match the tempo of the loop. In tap mode, you use the **slow (fast)** knob to define your subdivisions. This is such a neat feature. You can just tap-tempo to the actual beat of a track with the **control** foot switch, and then decide with the subdivision control if you want U2-like dotted 8th repeats or simple quarter note repeats.

The rest of the controls are straight forward **mix**, **feedback** (controls the number of repeats and saturation of the repeats) and **rate** and **depth** controls for the modulation of the repeats.

In **ramp** mode, the **slow (fast)** knob is used to control different tempos. Turn the knob to set the slow tempo and press down the bypass foot switch while turning it to set the fast tempo. When you hit the **control** switch, the delay speed ramps up from slow to fast, and ramps down to slow again when you release it. The _Ramp Time_ setting demonstrates that.

I like that the Wilderness is designed so that you _can_ use all those fancy features if you so desire. However, you can still just use it as a very nice sounding, modulated delay.
