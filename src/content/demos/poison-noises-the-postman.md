The Postman by Poison Noises delivers reliably funky tones in an envelope ... filter. (Sorry. Yes, all puns are intended but I'm also sorry.)

Being a Poison Noises pedal, this is a highly adjustable envelope filter with all the bells and whistles to create exactly the sound you have in your head.

Whenever you wanna let out the funk, but your feet are too lazy to operate a wah pedal, you should turn to the Postman.
