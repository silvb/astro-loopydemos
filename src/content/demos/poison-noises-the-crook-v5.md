The Crook by Poison Noises is a seriously good overdrive for guitar and fantastic for bass.

The Crook is extremely versatile. With the active EQ section, you get to shape your tone precisely how you want it to be. Fatten up your BASS, make it cut through the mix by boosting the MIDS (around 800Hz) or make it sound like a chainsaw by boosting the TREBLE.

You can adjust the headroom of the Crook by using the CLIPPING knob and get different kinds of breakup from it. Turn the GAIN down and the Crook becomes a cleanish/slightly dirty boost. Or crank it to get some really satisfying saturation.

If you're reading this, chances are you've heard of the Crook before on the JHS Show. I can understand all the praises from Addison and Josh. The Crook is a damn fine overdrive and I'm glad I got to try it out.
