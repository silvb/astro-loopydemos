The Cutting Room Floor by Recovery Effects is the quirkest lo-fi tape delay I've ever played.

You get all the good stuff that you expect from tape emulation: authentic sounding tape modulation (flutter and wow), tape saturation, and a warm, dark delay tones.

The whole pedal oozes lo-fi vibes. And labeling it as just a delay with some tape emulation would be a disservice. It's a lot more versatile than that.

You can squeeze unique vibrato and chorus sounds out of it and the tape saturation alone is worth the price of admission.
