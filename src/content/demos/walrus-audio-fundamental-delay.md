As with all the pedals from the Fundamentals series, the Walrus Audio Fundamental Delay has excellent value for money. I'd even argue this is the crown jewel of the whole series.

You get pristine digital delay, warm analog repeats and shoegaze-y reverse delay in a single pedal. Plus, it has tap tempo and subdivisions. It strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and versatility.

I believe the Fundamental Delay is completely digital and the analog mode is just a digital emulation of analog delay. But it sounds great and I'd have no complaints using this in place of a "real" analog delay.

I have yet to find a delay in this price range that offers reverse delay â€“ let alone with all the other modes and features I've mentioned.
