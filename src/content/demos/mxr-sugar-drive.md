The Sugar Drive by MXR is a Klon-type drive pedal. That means its sound is characterized by a mid-push with some bass roll-off, hard clipping diodes and the drive control is actually a clean/dirt blend knob.

My honest opinion on Klons and clones of Klons is: They all sound pretty much identical. Nobody will notice a difference in a mix. I'm also not super into Klons. They don't inspire me as much as other overdrives to play.

But, listening back the loop I recorded for this demo, I do think the Sugar Drive has a certain charm. The kind of compression it offers with medium drive has a nice chewyness to it.

It also features a switch to toggle the buffer circuit in bypass mode, which can be a nice feature on the pedalboard.

If you're into the sound of Klons but don't want to spend the price of a used car for one, you should try the Sugar Drive. MXR's build quality is excellent, it looks cool and the mini format can be squeezed onto any pedalboard.
