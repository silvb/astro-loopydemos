There's just a handful of things I regularly get excited about: shoegazy reverbs and fuzz, chicken wings with hot sauce ... and lo-fi chorus/vibrato pedals. Luckily, the BB03 Lo-Fi Chorus from Buzzing Bugs Audio Devices fulfills at least one of those things.

I like how all the controls of this pedal are super interactive. **DEPTH** and **AGE** are like two co-dependent lovers who can't live without the other but together they breed chaos.

**ROOM** adds decay to the slap-back delay but also increases the feedback to the modulation circuit which creates this overloaded sweet saturation.

**MIX** goes from completely dry vibrato to wet chorus effect.

I think the BB03 does more than just the tape/lo-fi thing and adds its own special character to the mix. Definitely worth checking out!
