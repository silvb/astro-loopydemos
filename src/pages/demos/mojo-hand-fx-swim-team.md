The Swim Team by Mojo Hand FX is a chorus and flanger with finely tuned, simple controls that make it impossible to get a bad sound out of this pedal.

I think Mojo really nailed the initial product experience with the Swim Team. All knobs at noon, either chorus or flanger, just sounds instantly fantastic.

I found the sounds really inspiring to play and come up with 80s inspired indie/dream-pop rock music.

The chorus mode sounds bubbly and lush while the flanger has just the right amount of feedback control. It never goes into an obnoxious airplaine _woooosh_, and just adds enough resonance to spice things up tastefully.

### Recording Notes

**Guitar**

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (both pickups)
- [Calamity Drive](/demos/plain-speak-calamity-drive) for a chimey edge of breakup sound
- Swim Team
- [Strymon Iridium (chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)

**Bass**

- JMJ Fender Mustang, D'Addario Half Rounds, played with pick, tone 100%
- [Calamity Drive](/demos/plain-speak-calamity-drive)
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini)
- Strymon Iridium (round) [with bass cabs](/posts/strymon-iridium-bass-ownhammer-ir/)

**Ambient Pad**

- The main guitar track fed into the [CBA Mood](/demos/chase-bliss-audio-mood), 100% wet, in reverb mode with a micro loop in stretch mode
- Turned down low in the mix. It's one of those sounds that you just notice when you turn them off

**Overdubs**

- Stellarosa (neck pickup)
- [Calamity Drive](/demos/plain-speak-calamity-drive)
- Swim Team (flanger mode)
- CBA Mood for a reverse delay
- Iridium
- Panned 50% left and right

**Lead Guitar**

- Stellarosa on the bridge pickup
- [Calamity Drive](/demos/plain-speak-calamity-drive) with "Goose" engaged
- Swim Team in flanger mode
- CBA Mood for a reverse delay
- Iridium

**Drums**

- GarageBand Drummer Gavin (indie rock) on the Brooklyn kit
- Whole kit treated with the stock GarageBand RAT-style pedal plugin

The whole mix was "mastered" with exciter, limiter and mild compression in the DAW.
