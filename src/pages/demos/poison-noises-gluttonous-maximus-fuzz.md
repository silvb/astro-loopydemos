The Gluttonous Maximus Fuzz by Poison Noises is a gated fuzz with tons of tweakability.

I love that there are multiple knobs that kinda control the level of fuzz (GAIN, BIAS and CLIPPING), yet I couldn't find a cleanish sound in there. It's all fuzz, all the time. And I love it.

There are a lot of different textures to explore. Every setting seems to thoroughly destroy the guitar signal (in a good way). It can get gated and lo-fi trashy or full-on distortion/fuzz.

The TONE knob surprised me. It's more of a mid control. On the lowest setting, it comes very close to a Big Muff (which kinda makes sense). Turning up the mids gets you that mid-pushed QOTSA tone.

The Gluttonous Maximus is a fuzz for people who've tried all the typical fuzzes and are searching for a sound that's uniquely their own.
