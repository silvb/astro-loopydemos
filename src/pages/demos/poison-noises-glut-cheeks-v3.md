The Glut Cheeks V3 by Poison Noises gives you vintage fuzz vibes without the vintage hassle.

Glut Cheeks has all the sounds and features I want out of a 60's Tone Bender inspired pedal: Great clean-up, a wide range of fuzz tones, and a bias knob to dial in the perfect amount of sputter.

Use the STRENGTH control to dial in a tone similar to fuzz with the guitar volume rolled back. Manipulate the BIAS create either a velcro fuzz or a blasting, raw and open sounding fuzz.
