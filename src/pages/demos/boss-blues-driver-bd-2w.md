The BOSS Blues Driver BD-2w from the Waza Craft series is an absolute sleeper overdrive pedal.

The naming is unfortunate, because it can do much more than blues and dad rock. It's just a great overdrive at every step of the gain range. From low to medium gain to fuzzy sounds, it does a great job.

With the Waza Craft add-ons – better components and the fat switch (basically the Robert Keeley mod from back in the days) – it's a workhorse of an overdrive and is very usable in many genres.

For my ears, this should be called the "Indie Driver". I've heard rumours that shoegazers love it, too!
