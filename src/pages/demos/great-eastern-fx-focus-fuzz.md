The Focus Fuzz by Great Eastern FX is a simple, no-nonsense fuzz that just sounds great at every setting.

Even though there are just 3 controls, you can get a lot of mileage out of this pedal. The FOCUS knob seems to shift the mid-range response. As the name implies, the fuzz sounds more focused when you turn this knob clockwise.

Like any good fuzz, it's very responsive to your picking dynamics and has a rich and present overdrive sound with the guitar volume rolled back.

I'm not exactly sure where the Focus Fuzz sits in terms of topology. It feels like a silicon fuzz and sounds similar to a fuzz face, but much more sorted in its low-end response.

At the time of this writing, there are only 250 units available (probably due to transistors being hard to come by). Go get one while you can.
