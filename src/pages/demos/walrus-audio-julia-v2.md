I don't often use chorus or vibrato. But when I do, I choose the Walrus Audio Julia Analog Chorus/Vibrato. It's super versatile. You can do anything from adding just a bit of movement, lush choruses to super wobbly vibrato.

The **D-C-V** knob lets you blend chorus and vibrato effect. It's technically a mix/blend knob that controls the levels of the dry and the modulated signal.

The **lag** knob gives you control over the delay time and therefore alters the perceived intensity of the modulation.
