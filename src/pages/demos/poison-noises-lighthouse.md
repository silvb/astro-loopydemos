The Lighthouse by Poison Noises is a photo-univibe with integrated drive.

The combination of drive and univibe is a classic combo if you ever listened to blues rock รก la Hendrix.

A few key features make this accessible vibe a real gem: There is loads of volume on tap to push your amp or other drive pedals, which creates this massive, pulsating bass bloom.

ATTACK and DECAY are subtle controls to tweek the feel of the univibe modulation.

The DRIVE to me almost feels like some kind of tape saturation. It's gentle and "transparent" and does not overpower the gain staging of your signal chain. It stacks really well with other drives or just your amp on the edge of breakup.

Try the Lighthouse if you're still on the hunt for the right vibe!
