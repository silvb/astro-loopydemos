The Koldwave by Freqscene Effects Co. is a real gem of chorus/vibrato pedal.

The controls are cleverly chosen to provide a simple, straight-forward user interface. But at the same time, it provides some deeper options to explore.

There are the obvious **SPEED** and **DEPTH** knobs as well as a toggle to switch between vibrato and chorus mode.

The juicy part starts with the tiny knobs. Turn **AMP** up to boost your overall signal and get your amp to break up for some dirty modulation. Adjust **FREQ** to make treble or bass of the modulated signal part more or less pronounced.

The star of all the controls is the **WARP** knob. From the manual: _Introduces a delay in LFO regeneration causing intense warped vinyl and detuned rubber band sounds. For a classic CE-2 tone, turn it just 5% up._

**WARP** is different than **DEPTH**. Both knobs are very interactive it seems. But **WARP** adds a more unpredictable swirl to the overall modulation, which totally changes the whole character of the pedal.

I have a feeling that the Koldwave is going to become my go-to chorus pedal in the future. I really recommend that you check out this vibe machine!
