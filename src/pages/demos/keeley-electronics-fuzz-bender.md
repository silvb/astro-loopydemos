The Fuzz Bender by Keeley Electronics is a versatile fuzz pedal that combines the best of vintage and modern fuzz tones. It's based on the Tone Bender circuit, but with a few modern twists. The Fuzz Bender has a wide range of fuzz tones, from smooth and creamy to aggressive and gated.

The range of the EQ controls is massive to dial in a variety of sounds. **BIAS** allows you to control the amount of voltage going to the transistors, which can drastically change the character of the fuzz.

Just like its vintage couterparts, the Fuzz Bender can work great as an overdrive pedal in disguise.

I like how the guitar melts into a full band mix with the Fuzz Bender. It doesn't get drowned like it sometimes happens with Big Muffs in the wrong context. It provides this special texture to a track that makes it stand out and gives it character.
