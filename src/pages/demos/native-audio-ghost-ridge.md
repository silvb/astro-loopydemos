The Ghost Ridge by NativeAudio is a modulated multi-reverb. It has hall, plate, room and spring reverb and can save up to 4 presets. And you get all of those things with just 2 knobs and 2 foot switches.

All of the different reverb settings sound excellent to me and make it really easy to dial in a sound that I like and that fits into the mix.

With the **mix** knob, you control the wetness of the signal. Press and hold the **on** switch, and the same knob switches between the different reverb modes (indicated by the 4 LEDs).

The **depth** knob controls the length of the reverb tail, and it's secondary function **mod** controls the depth of the modulation of the reverb tail. With the **room** mode, the modulation dimed and with a shorter reverb tail, you can almost get vibrato/chorus tones out of the Ghost Ridge.

I think NativeAudio made some very clever design choices when putting together all these tasteful reverb sounds and added a modulation control on top.
