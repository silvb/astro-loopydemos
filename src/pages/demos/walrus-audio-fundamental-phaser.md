The Fundamental Phaser by Walrus Audio is an accessible vibe machine to add psychedelic mojo to your guitar tracks.

The most classic Phasers are pretty simple themselves â€“ sometimes featuring only one knob. The Fundamental Phaser offers more flexibility while staying simple and approachable.

I especially like the feedback control, which can make the phaser effect more obvious and adds a little bit of a flanger-like sound to the mix.

### Signal Chain

- Fidelity Guitars Stellarosa Lite II with Lollar Firebird pickups (both pickups)
- Fundamental Phaser
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) into the [MAE Line Blur](/demos/mask-audio-electronics-line-blur).

I recorded the guitar directly into the audio interface without any amp simulation. I used the Keeley Compressor and the MAE Line Blur EQ to shape the tone for this lo-fi hip-hop inspired demo track. I also feel the phaser effect is more pronounced with this direct, clean tone.
