The Onederwall by Oneder Effects delivers all the gain you'll ever need.

The right side of the pedal is a Big Muff circuit that is tastefully voiced â€“ something between a Ram's Head and a Russian Big Muff. With the bolts âš¡ toggle, you can choose between different voicings.

The left side is basically the Onederbolt Distortion. With two different clipping options and a boost toggle, you can dial in a cleanish boost, vintage voiced overdrive or textured distortion.

Even though there are a lot of knobs and toggles on the pedal, I think you'll figure it out pretty quickly and you'll find great gain sounds easily.

If you don't like Onederwall, I'm not sure I can help you ðŸ˜…
