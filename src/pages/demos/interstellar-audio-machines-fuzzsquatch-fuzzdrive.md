The Fuzzsquatch Fuzzdrive by Interstellar Audio Machines is a great version of an Op-amp Big Muff.

I think Op-amp Big Muffs are actually my favorite kind of Big Muff. They have this very pleasing, zippy texture to them. Because of their mid-scooped tone and their huge amount of bottom end, they sound massive.

In theory, they should be hard to sit in a mix. But I actually found the Fuzzsquatch Fuzzdrive to record very easily. It's very present in the mix and if paired with the right bass sound, makes for nice creamy riffage.

The tonestack bypass toggle opens up the circuit to be less mid-scooped. This can be useful for recording overdubs or double tracked guitars to create a wall of sound.

I also found that the [IAM Octonaut Hyperdrive](/demos/interstellar-audio-machines-octonaut-hyperdrive) stacks really well with the Fuzzsquatch. Since this is a take on the Klon, I thought it worked really well as kind of a treble booster into the Fuzzsquatch. Or put it after the Fuzzsquatch to tighten the low-end and tame some of the highs. The latter has a similar feel to it than just bypassing the tonestack, but it's a bit more flexible because you can use the Hyperdrive's tone knob to tailor it to your needs.

If you're after that Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) sound or just want a great, massive sounding fuzz, the Fuzzsquatch is a great option.
