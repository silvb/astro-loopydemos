Walrus Audio calls the M1 a **High-fidelity Modulation Machine**. After running it through its paces, I think it's more than just a multi modulation pedal.

The M1 is a sound design tool made for hands-on studio production. While all the modulation algorithms in this pedal sound great, the real strength lies in its tweakability together with the lo-fi options.

This pedal is made for adding character and vibe to your track. Add some crackle, warble and tasteful lo-fi filtering to your sound and put the cherry on top by picking a lush stereo modulation.

Walrus packed a ton of features into the M1 with all the secondary functions. You can see and hear that there was a lot of research and design going into the making of this pedal.

I've tried to pack a lot of sounds into the demo and show you the most interesting knobs. Go have a look at [Walrus' website](https://www.walrusaudio.com/products/mako-series-m1-high-fidelity-modulation-machine?variant=42069616918763) to read the manual for more info.

Personally, I'm a simple dude. I would love to see a spin-off of the M1 that only has the lo-fi options together with the vinyl and tape vibrato.

In the generation of lo-fi chill & study beats, the M1 is a must-have to just really color your signal in lush to psychedelic modulation and add that lo-fi vibe.

## Recording Notes

I tried to keep this one short and simple, because the pedal is complex enough.

**Bass**

- JMJ Mustang, tone 50%, played with pick
- [Keeley Compressor Mini](/demos/keeley-electronics-compressor-mini) to even it out
- [Iridium with AmpegÂ® cab IRs](/posts/strymon-iridium-bass-ownhammer-ir) and just a little bit of grit

**Drums**

- GarageBand drummer (Liverpool kit, indie rock drummer Gavin)
- Processed with the M1 to add some grit and lofi character
- Clean and processed drums panned slightly left and right to create more space in the mix

**Guitar**

- K'mo Memphis (tele pickups, middle position)
- Keeley Compressor Mini, just enough to make the guitar a little squishy
- M1
- Iridium with the usual chime setting

Everything was mixed in GarageBand with minimal post processing.

### Signal Chain

- K'mo Memphis Std., classic T-style pickups (both pickups)
- M1
- [Strymon Iridium (Chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)
- Focusrite Scarlett 2i2
- Garageband
