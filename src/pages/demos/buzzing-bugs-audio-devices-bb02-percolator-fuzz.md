The BB02 Percolator Fuzz by Buzzing Bugs Audio Devices is a no-nonense take on the Harmonic Percolator circuit.

It's a simple, two-knob fuzz that sounds great and is easy to dial in. It's gnarly from the get-go with its sweet harmonics that is so typical for percolators and unlike any other type of fuzz.
