The Dunsh by Champion Leccy is a fuzz/overdrive/distortion box that elegantly combines a few trades I love in pedal design:

1. It is quirky. Not only the look of the enclosure design, but the whole thing gives off mad professor vibes. With the gate and bias controls, it can sound unique and unpredictable.
2. You can get a great sound out of it easily without having to know what each knob is doing.
3. It wants to be explored. There is a myriad of ways to combine different modes for gated, boosted, soft and nasty sounds.

Without knowing the technical details, here's what I gathered from experimenting with the pedal:

The two lo/mid/hi toggles correspond to the bass (B) and treble (T) knobs and which part of the frequency spectrum they affect. So you get kind of a semi-parametric EQ section.

GAIN, BIAS and GATE are all highly interactive with each other. The GATE toggle flips different levels of gating and has different voicings â€“ from really gated and "smushy" to "just a little gated".

The DUNSH mode is an internal boost to one of the transistor stages and the DUNSH control is just a separate volume control for this boost. This is smart because the interal boost adds compression which might be perceived as less loud when engaged. This way you can compensate for that.

I would imagine that the Dunsh is a great all-in-one solution for recording studios. You can simply get great drive/distortion tones from this. But, mostly, it's a great tool for adding a certain kind of flavour that you can't get from other pedals.
