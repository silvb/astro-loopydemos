The Excess V2 by Old Blood Noise Endeavors is wild combination of crunchy, rodent-inspired distortion and a colorful selection of modulation effects.

The Excess is perfect for out-of-the-box sound design inside a simple but versatile box.

From ambient, to shoegaze, post rock, simple indie rock riffs and everything in between â€“ the Excess is a great pedal to get yourself out of a writing rut and just explore new sounds.

The Modulation section offers a cascading **FIFTH** harmonic delay, a simple **CHORUS** and a short **DELAY**. I think the **FIFTH** is what distinguishes the Excess from other distortion/modulation combinations. It has this magical/ethereal vibe but in a quirky way that pairs well with the distortion.

The distortion is a modded RAT circuit. Lower gain settings are achievable below 9 o'clock and it gets very saturated quickly past that point.

Overall, the Excess is definitely not a subtle pedal, but meant to paint a broad stroke of color on your sound.
