The Crook by Poison Noises is one of the best all-around overdrive pedals I've come across.

It sounds excellent on guitar and is phenomenal on bass. I might do a separate bass demo just to showcase how great this sounds on bass.

The way the clipping is achieved with The Crook is extremely satisfying. There is a crunch and chewyness to it without it ever getting honky, harsh or muffled.

I think my favorite clipping configuration is _The Goods_ in top position and _Switcheroo_ in down position.

The two separate EQ controls make this a versatile overdrive for guitar and bass. For guitar, I like to cut bass with _Lay Low_ and make it stand out in a mix by dialing up _High Tail_. For bass, it gets really beefy when cranking _Lay Low_ and dialing in _High Tail_ to taste.

### Recording Notes

- K'mo Memphis Std., classic T-style pickups (both pickups)
- The Crook
- [Strymon Iridium (Chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)
- Focusrite Scarlett 2i2
- Garageband

**Bass**

- JMJ Fender Mustang Bass

The whole mix was "mastered" with exciter, limiter and mild compression.
